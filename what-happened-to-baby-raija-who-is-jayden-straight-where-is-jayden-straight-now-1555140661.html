A eight-month-old baby girl Raija died after suffering internal injuries and her father Jayden Straight was sentenced to 100 years in prison for killing her.<h2><span>What Happened to Baby Raija?</span></h2><p><span>Raija was urgently transported to a hospital in Iowa due to severe and traumatic head injuries. Tragically, she succumbed to her injuries and passed away on July 14, 2018. The attending doctor, who provided medical care to Raija before her unfortunate demise, stated that her injuries were the result of a deliberate assault, ruling out any possibility of them being unintentional or accidental.</span></p><p><span>Jayden Straight, the father of Raija, admitted his culpability in the death of his daughter and pleaded guilty for his role in the tragic incident. The details surrounding the circumstances leading up to Raija's injuries and subsequent death revealed the severity of the assault she endured. The injuries included multiple skull fractures and broken ribs, which inflicted immense physical trauma on the young child.</span></p><p><span>This devastating event left the community and Raija's loved ones in profound grief, as they struggled to comprehend the loss of an innocent life and the tragedy of such violence perpetrated against a defenseless child. The consequences of this tragic incident serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting and ensuring the well-being of vulnerable individuals, particularly young children, within our society.</span></p><h2><span>Who is Jayden Straight?&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Jayden Straight, who was 17 years old at the time of the tragic incident, subjected his eight-month-old daughter, Raija, to a brutal assault that left her with severe internal injuries. The extent of her injuries included multiple skull fractures, broken ribs, a ruptured spleen, and extensive retinal hemorrhaging. This horrific act occurred in July 2018 when Straight was entrusted with caring for Raija while his partner, Ri Bambino, briefly went to the shops in Des Moines, Iowa.</span></p><p><span>Upon Bambino's return, she discovered her precious baby suffering from unimaginable injuries, and Straight had already fled from their residence. The following day, Straight turned himself in to the police, although he failed to provide any explanation for the inflicted wounds on his daughter. Tragically, Raija's injuries proved fatal, and she passed away on July 14, 2018.</span></p><p><span>A doctor who attended to Raija at the hospital before her death confirmed that her injuries were a result of a deliberate assault, dismissing any possibility of them being unintentional or accidental. Straight eventually pleaded guilty to his involvement in his daughter's tragic demise.</span></p><p><span>Initially, Straight was sentenced to 50 years in prison. However, the court later imposed additional sentences, totaling five decades, for three counts of willful injury and two counts of child endangerment resulting in serious injury. Given that the sentences will run consecutively, Straight is projected to remain incarcerated until 2119 before he becomes eligible for release.</span></p><p><span>Raija's great-grandmother, Robin Head, expressed the indescribable pain and loss caused by this heartbreaking event. She reminisced about the joy Raija brought to her life during the eight months they spent together, cherishing the memories of holding her, laughing with her, touching her, and sharing in her milestones.</span></p><h2><span>Where is Jayden Straight Now?</span></h2><p><span>At first, Jayden Straight received a prison sentence of 50 years as a result of his actions. However, the court decided to impose further penalties, amounting to a total of five decades, due to his involvement in three counts of willful injury and two counts of child endangerment resulting in serious injury. These additional sentences were stacked consecutively, meaning that Straight will serve each sentence successively rather than concurrently.</span></p><p><span>As a result of the consecutive sentencing, it is projected that Straight will remain in prison until the year 2119 before he becomes eligible for any possibility of release. This extended incarceration period reflects the gravity of his actions and serves as a significant punitive measure for the harm caused to his daughter and the severity of the charges brought against him.</span></p><p><span>The court's decision to impose such a lengthy prison term underscores the seriousness of Straight's crimes and the need for justice in cases involving the abuse and endangerment of children. The imposed sentence aims to ensure that Straight is held accountable for his actions and serves as a deterrent to others who might consider committing similar acts of violence and harm against innocent and vulnerable individuals.</span></p><h2><span>Raija Baby Death</span></h2><p><span>During a heartfelt vigil held in memory of 8-month-old Raija Straight, her mother, Ri Bambino, expressed overwhelming grief while her great-grandmother spoke about Raija's life. Emotionally composed, Ri Bambino urged everyone present to remember her daughter's name, emphasizing the importance of honoring Raija's memory.</span></p><p><span>More than 100 individuals gathered near 10th and Clark streets, holding balloons and candles, to pay their respects to Raija, who tragically passed away at Mercy Hospital. Court records revealed that Raija suffered from serious internal injuries and traumatic head injuries, including multiple skull fractures, broken ribs, and other internal damage.</span></p><p><span>Jayden Straight, her 17-year-old father, turned himself in and was subsequently charged with first-degree murder and child endangerment resulting in death, making Raija's case the seventh homicide of 2018. At the vigil, family and friends held signs with messages such as "Long live Raija" and "Justice for Raija." Raija's great-grandmother, Robin Head, and her grandmother, Tisha Wells, reflected on the short yet impactful life of the little girl.</span></p><p><span>Robin Head spoke emotionally about the joy Raija brought to her life during their eight months together, cherishing the moments of holding, laughing, and walking with her. She described Raija's adventurous nature, recounting how she would explore and wander, leaving her loved ones to follow along and support her in her curiosity. Robin Head expressed her belief that Raija's spirit will always be with them, guided by a higher power.</span></p><p><span>Tisha Wells, Raija's grandmother, referred to her as her "Little Ray" and highlighted her happy and loving nature, characterized by a radiant smile. During the vigil, Raija's great-grandmother, Rhonda Anderson, called for action and urged everyone to stand up for justice in Raija's case. She emphasized the need for unwavering commitment until justice is served for the innocent baby. In support of the family, a Go Fund Me page was created to accept donations for their benefit.</span></p><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>What Happened to Baby Raija? - FAQs</h2>1.
