She's a country singer, an actress, a doll designer, an entrepreneur, an author, a <a href=#>Nutrisystem spokeswoman</a>, and a loving mom! Since the <a href=#>former child star</a> definitely isn't slowing down anytime soon, scroll down to see your biggest questions about Marie, answered.</p><h2>Is Marie Osmond married?</h2><p>Marie actually has the <a href=#>sweetest love story</a> with her husband, Steve Craig. The pair got married in 1982, but unfortunately, they divorced in 1985. Marie then married Brian Blosil in 1986, and they spent 21 years together before splitting in 2007. In 2011, <a href=#>Marie remarried Steve</a> — while wearing the same dress from their first wedding! The pair still seems head over heels for each other, too. Marie <a href=#>recently posted</a> a photo of herself hugging her hubby with the caption, "on vacation with my sweetheart." So cute!</p><h2>Who are Marie Osmond's children?</h2><p>Marie has <a href=#>quite a brood</a>! She shares one son with Steve named Stephen, who was born during their first three-year marriage. Marie had two biological kids with Brian named Rachael and Matthew, and they also adopted five children: Jessica, Michael (who sadly <a href=#>took his own life</a> at just 18 years old), Brandon, Brianna, and Abigail. Today, all of Marie's kids are relatively private people living normal lives. The singer also has <a href=#>three grandchildren</a>.</p><h2>Did Marie Osmond win Dancing With the Stars?</h2><p>Marie competed on the fifth season of Dancing With the Stars in 2007, but unfortunately she didn't win. She definitely held her own, though! She came in third place, and made a huge splash when she actually passed out after one performance! Luckily she was okay, she simply said she "forgot to breathe."</p><h2>When is Marie Osmond's birthday?</h2><p>Marie just recently rang in her 58th birthday on Oct. 13, 2017. She celebrated by going on vacation with her husband and thanking friends for their kind wishes.</p><h2>Who are Marie Osmond's parents and siblings?</h2><p>Marie's parents were Olive May and George Virl Osmond. The Utah couple raised their nine kids in the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The whole family was involved in showbiz, except for her brothers Virl and Tom, who were born deaf. Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, and Jimmy Osmond were all performers, but <a href=#>Donny was most famous</a> for being a pop heartthrob and singing duets with Marie. Sadly, Olive died in 2004 and George passed away in 2007, just days before he was supposed to join his entire family (including his 55 grandkids and 48 great-grandkids) on the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>Author Sheri L Dew once said, "Few of us will reach our potential without the nurturing of both the mother who bore us and the mothers who bear with us." My Mom did bear nine children but she had a way of making each of us feel as if we were her favorite and the only child in the world who was important to her. And let me tell you, she was not only adorable but she always knew how to break the ice and make us laugh during a hard day's work. I remember some of my favorite times with her were when I was working to try to memorize all those original Donny & Marie shows. (350 pages of script in 2 1/2 days)😜 My mom would come into my room and bring me a banana for potassium and try and help me. At times I would feel so overwhelmed but she always found a way to laugh me through it. We'd get so silly… she taught me I could laugh myself through anything!!! ❤️ I love her for that! She was charitable and endured long suffering when her children faced illnesses, fears or personal challenges. Olive Osmond was kind, never easily provoked, not puffed up or envied other women. She knew she was a daughter of God and taught me, her daughter, my worth as a woman to a loving Heavenly Father. She is everything Paul talked about in 1st Corinthians 13 and had the pure love of Christ. I realize that I am so blessed to have had such a nurturing and highly-organized Mom and my heart goes out to those who might not have been raised in the same type of environment as I was during their childhood. This is a different generation and in today's world we face various challenges that never existed for our mothers previously. We find ourselves striving to balancing motherhood and having to make a living. Life is tougher now than ever. I do know your struggles and I salute you beautiful and dedicated women for all that you go through daily to make ends meet… Go to my Facebook @ MarieOsmond for the rest of my #MothersDay Sunday message. Tell me about your favorite female figure and I would love if you'd post her photo. I love and pay a tribute to you all on this #MothersDay! So true isn't it, that God could not be everywhere, so therefore he created Mothers, Aunts & Mothers-at-Heart!</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Marie Osmond</a> (@marieosmond) on May 14, 2017 at 11:16am PDT</p><h2>What is Marie Osmond's real name?</h2><p>Believe it or not, Marie Osmond is actually a stage name. Her real name is Olive Marie Osmond and she was named after her mother. As the only girl in the family, it makes sense that Marie was given her mother's name. However, she's used Marie since the very start of her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6rq3Ropxmp6OivK%2BwjGprbWxjaHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html&text=Who%20Is%20Marie%20Osmond%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Talented%20Singer%20and%20Actress&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marie%20Osmond%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Talented%20Singer%20and%20Actress" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marie%20Osmond%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Talented%20Singer%20and%20Actress" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marie%20Osmond%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Talented%20Singer%20and%20Actress" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-marie-osmond-144433.html&description=Who%20Is%20Marie%20Osmond%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Talented%20Singer%20and%20Actress" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-monica-garcia-get-to-know-the-rhoslc-season-4-newcomer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Monica Garcia?
