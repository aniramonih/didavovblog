Order</span><span>&nbsp;where she played the role of Claire Kincaid, the Assistant District Attorney.&nbsp;She also made subsequent appearances in other quality movies, as well as sitcoms, including the most recent 2019 TV series&nbsp;</span><span>City on the Hill</span><span>&nbsp;in which she played Jenny Rhodes.&nbsp;Besides, it should be noted that Hennessy also has multiple skills as she is a successful entrepreneur and musician.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Short biography and age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jillian Noel Hennessy, born in Edmonton, Alberta, her date of birth is recorded as November 25, 1968, but regardless of her age, Hennessy looks young and full of energy and can pass for a woman in her 40s.&nbsp;She attended Stanley Park Senior Public School and from there progressed to Grand River Collegiate Institute.&nbsp;Back in high school, Jill Hennessy took up modeling, and as soon as she got to college she started acting, thanks to her drama teacher for motivation.&nbsp;Later, she decided to learn to play the guitar so that she could earn some money from the voluntary contributions she would have obtained by singing and playing in the streets of Toronto.&nbsp;Besides,</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jill Hennessy began her career alongside her sister Jacqueline.&nbsp;They featured as Jack and Jill in&nbsp;</span><span>Dead Ringers</span><span>&nbsp;in 1988 and after a few television roles she was nominated for the role of Dana Scully for the movie&nbsp;</span><span>X Files,</span><span>&nbsp;however, she did not get enough success from of movie.&nbsp;Soon after, she managed to get into a hit television series, Law & Order, in which she played the role of Claire Kincaid.&nbsp;Her role ended in the third season after her character, Claire Kincaid, died in an accident.&nbsp;Another major film for Hennessy was&nbsp;</span><span>Crossing Jordan</span><span>&nbsp;in which she was cast as Jordan Cavanaugh.&nbsp;She also acted in other films</span><span>RoboCop, Chutney Popcorn, Most Wanted, A Smile Like Yours Madam Secretary</span><span>&nbsp;and recently she was seen in the 2018 sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Bulls</span></p><p><span>As a musician, Jill Hennessy released her first album in 2009 which she named&nbsp;</span><span>Ghost in my head</span><span>&nbsp;and a second album followed 6 years later, in 2015 with the title&nbsp;</span><span>I do.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jill Hennessy has amassed a net worth of $12 million for herself, which stems from her varied sources of income – as an actress, singer and co-owner of a restaurant.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family, twin sister, husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>The parents of this multi-talented actress are John and Maxine Hennessy.&nbsp;His father was a trader who worked in the meat business and spent much of his time doing so.&nbsp;More so, he had to make several business trips and move from time to time, which partly explains why Hennessy had lived in nine different states before he even turned eighteen.&nbsp;Jill Hennessy is also known to have two siblings namely, John Paul, her younger brother, and Jacqueline, her identical twin who once acted in theater but is currently a talented journalist and TV host.</span></p><p>Hennessy’s parents separated when she was just 14 and her father, along with her mother, Hennessy’s grandmother, had to come together to raise her in Ontario.</p><p><span>Jill Hennessy has ancestry from her father, Ireland, France, Sweden and Italy, and from her mother, she is of Ukrainian Roma and Austrian descent.</span></p><p><span>Jill Hennessy is the wife of actor Paolo Mastropietro who, like her, also finds the bicycle interesting and as such they sometimes have fun together.&nbsp;Her marriage to Paolo Mastropietro is now 18 years old.&nbsp;Paolo Mastropietro is a 54 year old actor.&nbsp;He was born in New York, United States.&nbsp;Paolo was known for his roles in&nbsp;</span><span>Renegade Force</span><span>&nbsp;1998,&nbsp;</span><span>Exit Wounds</span><span>&nbsp;2001 and&nbsp;</span><span>Cradle to Grave</span><span>&nbsp;2003.</span></p><p><span>Hennessy and Paolo were not only lovers but also business partners before their marriage.&nbsp;Hennessy loved to cook and Paolo used to be a bartender.&nbsp;So they both pooled their skills to open a restaurant in New Jersey a year before tying the knot.&nbsp;Their wedding was a low-key ceremony, held on January 1, 2000, and celebrated a second time the following year.&nbsp;Their second wedding took place at New York City Hall, with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani presiding.&nbsp;Currently, Jill Hennessy and her adorable husband have 2 boys namely Marco and Gianni.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body stats – height</span></strong></h2><p><span>The multi-talented actress who stands 1.73m tall is known to keep a slim figure with a recorded weight of 135 kilos or around 61kg.</span></p><p class=postsid
