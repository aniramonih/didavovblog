The two tied the knot in 1996 and are parents to three kids.</strong></p><p>Among their three kids, their son, Killian McGinley, looked most likely to follow in his parents’ footsteps. But the youngster has now shifted his focus toward the financial world.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-mcginley-golfer.jpg><p>The Irish golfer Paul McGinley made several records while playing in the Ryder Cup tournament. He made three consecutive appearances in 2002, 2004, and 2006 and later captained the team to victory in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>It marked the first time an Irishman had captained Europe’s Ryder Cup side to victory. With the Ryder Cup starting in a few days, the Sky Sports Golf pundit has stated that the European team is no longer the undergoes.</p><p>The likes of <a href=# rel=noopener>Jon Rahm</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rory Mcilroy</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Matt Fitzpatrick</a> will all be seen in action at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Rome.</p><h2>Paul McGinley Wife, Allison McGinley</h2><p>Paul McGinley’s wife, Allison McGinley, met her husband at the United States International University in San Diego. The two of them were on golf scholarships in the late 1980s.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple comes from athletic families but played different sports growing up. If Paul was pulled by Gaelic football because of his dad, Allison always loved golf.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, Allison comes from a well-known golf family, the Shapcott family. The Shapcotts were part of Knowle Golf Club in Bristol, England.&nbsp;</p><p>Allison began playing golf at age 12, considered quite late in her family. Her younger sister, Susan, had already earned several accolades in the sport, and at the time, the two sisters used to be frequently compared to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparison can be the death of joy, so Allison left her sister’s shadow and traveled to the USA to play golf. As said by her coach at the time, Allison wasn’t considered a strong player and didn’t have a good swing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-mcginley-wife.jpg><p>However, during her time at USIU, Allison improved her overall gameplay. In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with the LA Times in 1988, Allison said being away from her sister helped her enormously.&nbsp;</p><p>When Susan arrived at USIU, she was shocked to see her sister’s improvement. Allison ranked no.25 during her junior year in the NCAA Division I women’s ranking.&nbsp;</p><p>She went on to play on the Ladies European Tour in 1992 and tied the knot with Paul in 1996. Like many female athletes during that time, Allison retired to raise her family.&nbsp;</p><p>Allison is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a> but hasn’t shared many posts. Her only post is that of her with her two daughters.&nbsp;</p><h2>Paul And Allison McGinley Share Three Kids&nbsp;</h2><p>With his spouse, Allison McGinley, the Irish golfer shares three kids who have chosen different career paths.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple’s eldest child, Niamh McGinley, earned a dual BA in history with Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University in 2022. She currently works for Summit Golf Brands as a Creative Coordinator.</p><p>Niamh has also shown interest in the fashion world. She previously worked with the American fashion designer Adam Lippes as a creative marketing associate for his brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Niamh had previously earned a foundation degree from the private Italian school Istituto Marangoni in 2018. She is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> with the username @niamh_mcginley and has shared a few of her creative works on her <a href=# rel=noopener>second handle</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paul-mcginley-kids.jpg><p>The only son of Paul and Allison, Killian McGinley followed his parents’ footsteps and was a golf athlete at Fairfield University. He played the sport until 2021, till his junior year.</p><p>The youngster is pursuing his Master’s Degree in Technology at UC Santa Barbara and previously interned at Bloc Ventures as a Financial Analyst.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple’s youngest daughter, Maia McGinley, studies at IE Law School and received a fellowship/Academic Excellence Scholarship.
