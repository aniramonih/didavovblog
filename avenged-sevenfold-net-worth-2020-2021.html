The band has produced record-breaking music, and it has spread worldwide. The band is a heavy metal band, and since its formation from 1999, the band has done a lot of concerts. With five band members, the music of the group has been praised worldwide for its music and lyrics, and it has been listed as one of the Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>Avenged Sevenfold was formed in March 1999 in California, and the founding members were Matt Sanders, Matt Wendt, and James Sullivan. The group’s name was inspired by the story of Cain and Able from the Bible, although the group isn’t much religious. Soon after their formation, they were joined by a high school acquaintance named Zachary Baker, who used to play in the punk-band MPA.</p><p>The band’s first creative output was just a three-track demo, and after this, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute their music to two compilations. In the end, they recorded two new songs and then released them along with the previously registered songs in early 2000. Soon Matt Wendt left for the college, and later band was joined by the bassist of Suburban Legends.</p><p>The group has a symbol which is known as Deathbat, and it was designed by Micah Montague which was one of their friends in High School, and the logo is used in most of their albums.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The debut album of the group was Seventh Trumpet, and it was then released in 2001, and they released this album while they were just in high school. They were only 18 when they released this album. They were back then signed by Goodlife Recording. The current lead Guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the release of this album. The major success came after the release of their second album, which was ‘Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet.’</p><p>The first album featured a lot of screamo, and Daemon Ash was replaced by the current bassist Johnny Christ. Soon after the second album, the group left the Hopeless Records for Warner Bros., and the company took an interest in them due to their aggressive and innovative sound. They released their second album 2003, which was known as ‘Walking The Fallen,’ and total sales it made were 175,000 copies in the USA.</p><p>They released their third album in 2005, and it was named as the City of Evil, and it became the most successful album of the band. It also got the 30th position in the U.S. Billboard chart and made over 730,000 sales.</p><p>The company kept touring, and a new member joined the group named The Rev., but his contribution to the group was short as he did in 2009, and since then, the group members were respected a lot by the people.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Avenged Sevenfold has been able to win two awards, and below are the awards that they have won.</p><ul><li>Kerrang! Award for Best Album in 2008.</li><li>MTV Video Music Award for the Best New Artist in 2006.</li></ul><h2>Net Worth of Avenged Sevenfold in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Avenged-Sevenfold-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The net worth of Avenged Sevenfold is estimated to be around $120 million, and all this earning comes from the music that the band made all these years. The group has been very successful, and the five albums released by the group have made many sales. The group also makes a lot of tours, and now let’s talk about the individual worth of band members.</p><p>The total net worth of M. Shadows is estimated to be around $20 million, and most of his net worth is from the music that he has made.

Synyster Gates is another founding member, and his total net worth is estimated to be around $16 million. The net worth of Zacky Vengeance is expected to be approximately $18 million and that of guitarist, Johnny Christ, estimated to be around $18 million.
