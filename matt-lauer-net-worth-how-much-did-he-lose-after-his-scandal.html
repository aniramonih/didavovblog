He was the co-host of NBC’s Today show for 20 years, earning an annual salary of $25 million at his peak. He also hosted several other programs, such as Dateline NBC, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. He was widely respected and admired by millions of viewers and colleagues.</p><p>However, his reputation and career came crashing down in November 2017, when he was fired by NBC after a female colleague accused him of sexual misconduct during the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The accusation also alleged that the inappropriate behavior continued in the workplace after the Olympics. Soon after, more women came forward with similar allegations against Lauer, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. Lauer denied any wrongdoing, but admitted that he had engaged in consensual sexual relationships with some of his co-workers.</p><p>The scandal not only cost Lauer his job, but also his marriage, his reputation, and a large chunk of his fortune. According to various sources, Lauer’s net worth is estimated to be around $80 million as of 2022. This is a significant drop from his previous net worth of $120-$150 million before the scandal. Here are some of the factors that contributed to his financial decline.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Divorce Settlement</strong></h3><p>Lauer was married to Annette Roque, a former model, since 1998. They had three children together: Jack, Romy, and Thijs. However, their marriage was reportedly rocky for years, and Roque filed for divorce in 2019, after Lauer’s scandal became public. The divorce was finalized in 2020, and according to People magazine, Lauer agreed to pay Roque a lump sum of $20 million as part of their settlement. He also gave up their horse farm in New Zealand<a href=# rel=noopener>2</a>, which they bought for $9 million in 2017.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Real Estate Losses</strong></h3><p>Lauer owned several properties across the country and abroad, but he had to sell some of them at a loss after his scandal. In 2018, he sold his Upper East Side apartment in New York City for $7.35 million3, which was less than the $7.45 million he paid for it in 2004. He also sold his Hamptons mansion in Sag Harbor for $36 million4 in 2020, which was below the $44 million he initially asked for it in 2019. He still owns another Hamptons estate in North Haven, which he bought for $36.5 million in 2016 as well as a lakefront property in New Zealand, which he bought for $13 million in 2017.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career Prospects</strong></h3><p>Lauer has been largely out of the public eye since his firing from NBC. He has not appeared on any television shows or podcasts, nor has he written any books or articles. He has occasionally been spotted by paparazzi or fans, but he has mostly kept a low profile. He has reportedly been working on a comeback attempt, but it is unclear if any network or platform would be willing to hire him or give him a platform, given the severity of the allegations against him and the backlash he would likely face from viewers and advertisers.</p><p>According to Page Six, Lauer has been pitching a documentary about his downfall to various media outlets, but he has not found any takers so far. He has also been rumored to be considering launching his own podcast or YouTube channel, but he has not confirmed or denied these speculations.</p><p>Lauer’s chances of reviving his career seem slim at best, especially as more details about his alleged misconduct have emerged over the years. In 2019, Ronan Farrow published a book called Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, which included an interview with Brooke Nevils, the former NBC employee who accused Lauer of raping her at the Sochi Olympics. Nevils claimed that Lauer forced himself on her in his hotel room, despite her repeated refusals and protests. Lauer denied the rape allegation, saying that he had an “extramarital, but consensual” sexual encounter with Nevils.</p><p>In 2020, another former NBC employee named Addie Zinone came forward with her story about having an affair with Lauer when she was 24 and he was 40<a href=# rel=noopener>11</a>. Zinone said that Lauer pursued her aggressively and used his power and influence to manipulate her into having sex with him in his office and other locations. She said that she felt ashamed and traumatized by the experience, and that she suffered from depression and anxiety for years afterwards.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Matt Lauer was once one of the most successful and influential figures in the television industry, but his career and reputation were destroyed by his own actions. He lost his job, his wife, his friends, and a large portion of his wealth due to his sexual misconduct. He also lost the trust and respect of millions of people who used to watch him and look up to him. His net worth is estimated to be around $80 million as of 2022, but it is unlikely that he will be able to increase it or regain his former status anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfoq61wIylmK6domK7psCMsKarrJhitbDDjKasnKBdmbaleceeZKWno5p6orLTnqlmoJmoerSvwKebmqRf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html&text=Matt%20Lauer%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Did%20He%20Lose%20After%20His%20Scandal%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html&title=Matt%20Lauer%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Did%20He%20Lose%20After%20His%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html&title=Matt%20Lauer%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Did%20He%20Lose%20After%20His%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html&title=Matt%20Lauer%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Did%20He%20Lose%20After%20His%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-lauer-net-worth-how-much-did-he-lose-after-his-scandal.html&description=Matt%20Lauer%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Did%20He%20Lose%20After%20His%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rose-zhang-parents-meet-haibin-zhang-and-li-cai.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Haibin Zhang and Li Cai">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./markell-washington.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Markell Washington- Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
