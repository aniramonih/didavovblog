Living with her pretentious but recently impoverished family, Anne Elliot is a nonconforming woman who tends to let those around her dictate her life. But when Captain Frederick Wentworth, the one who got away, comes back into her life abruptly, she must make her own decisions and listen to her heart to try and win him back.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Although it’s a timeless novel, the 2022 adaptation has been the subject of critical comments as many believe it to have missed the mark. However, whether or not you loved the movie, the following adaptations of <strong>Jane Austen</strong>’s novels are perfect for those who enjoy unlikely love, unbridled romance, and formidable female protagonists.</p><h3 id=h-10-emma-1996 data-injectable=false>10.

In it, Gwyneth Paltrow plays Emma, a young 19th-century Englishwoman who enjoys meddling in other people’s affairs. Although she’s a congenial young lady, she persistently sticks her nose in her friends’ business and attempts to matchmake them, at the expense of her own love life.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>With a beautiful setting, outstanding cast, and romance that sets hearts aflutter, it’s a classy, timeless comedy with a happy ending.

But when she decides to take control of her life, things heat up as her boss takes an interest in her, and a disagreeable acquaintance she can’t stop thinking about repeatedly makes appearances in her life. She finds herself in a Pride and Prejudice-like love triangle, which she recounts in her diary. In fact, Bridget Jones’s Diary is based on a book of the same name, and while it is not a direct adaptation, it is a reinterpretation of Pride and Prejudice.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>It’s a classic opposites attract situation with raunchy and realistic dialogue. It’s corny but cute and will have you asking the same question as Bridget – who is Mr. Right? The film will be available to stream on Netflix on August 1, 2022.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>8. Emma (2020)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Like in the 1996 version of the film by the same name, Emma Woodhouse is beautiful, rich, and clever – a big fish in the little pond of her sleepy town. She attempts to navigate the social nuances of English society while also trying to pair up her friends and neighbors with suitors who are just wrong for them. But while she meddles in the affairs of her friends, she almost misses her chance at love.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>The film modernizes the romance and comedy of Austen’s story. It’s stylish, aesthetic, and a charming period drama. With a terrific cast and a script that encapsulates the source material, it’s an authentic window into the 1800s. Emma is available to stream on Amazon Prime.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>7. Fire Island (2022)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Fire Island is a modern-day story inspired by Pride and Prejudice. When Noah, an Elizabeth Bennet-type, swears off men hoping to get his best friend laid at Fire Island, a place known for its gay villages, he gets more than he bargained for. After the pair set out to have a legendary week-long trip, Noah meets Will, who goes from being a nuisance to a heartthrob.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>It’s a contemporary romantic comedy that showcases the diverse, multicultural analysis of queerness and love. It’s rated R for strong sexual content, language throughout, drug use, and some nudity. Fire Island is available for streaming on Hulu.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>6. Clueless (1995)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>Cher Horowitz is pretty, popular, and rich. But she’s also nosy, shallow, and a bit vain. Though good-natured, Cher is naive and has a lifestyle that revolves around her expensive taste and the social hierarchy at her high school. She fills her time by matchmaking her friends and teachers while neglecting her own love life. And while her outward demeanor seems superficial, she’s a charming, empathetic, and intelligent young woman just trying to find her way in life.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>This modern-day high school equivalent of Emma will have you falling in love with the actress who plays the heroine, Alicia Silverstone, and the actor who plays opposite her, Paul Rudd.

However, she realizes that being wealthy and pompous isn’t a desirable goal for her. When she grows up, she becomes a beautiful young lady with a keen mind.

When the main character, Catherine Morland, is invited to stay with the childless Allen family in Bath, she’s hoping to get the type of adventure that she’s been reading about in novels. However, her penchant for sensational gothic stories leads to her misunderstanding her own matters of the heart.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>The film is a riveting performance by the cast and has a twist that would have made Austen proud.

Both refuse to let go of their pride and prejudice and almost miss a chance at true happiness.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>It’s a humorous story about love and life, with beautiful locations, a great script, and excellent performances by the actors.
