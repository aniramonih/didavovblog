Clarke wrote most of the album, with Gore contributing two tracks, “Tora! Tora! Tora!” and the instrumental “Big Muff”. “Any Second Now (voices)” features Gore’s first lead vocals for the band. Gore sings lead vocals on several of the band’s songs, notably ballads, his tenor voice providing a contrast to Gahan’s dramatic baritone. When Clarke announced his departure from Depeche Mode in 1981, Gore became the principal songwriter for the band. Gore had been writing material since the age of 12. Songs Gore wrote for Depeche Mode’s second album, A Broken Frame (1982) differed musically and lyrically from Clarke’s. Gore’s writing became gradually darker and more political on subsequent Depeche Mode albums.</p><h2>Martin Gore Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Martin Gore is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United Kingdom.
