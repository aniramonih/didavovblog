The company was founded by Scott Jordan, and it makes garments that have special features such as conduit systems and garments having specialized pockets and compartments which can hold phones, tablets, and other electronic devices that are portable.</p><p>The company was started to make garments mainly for travelers, but now the company is marketed towards a variety of people such as the military and the law-enforcement people who need to carry many portable electronic devices and also to manage and control their wires.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>SCOTTeVEST was founded by Scott Jordan in Chicago, Illinois, in 2000. Their first product was called “eVest,” hence the name of the company. This garment was just a techie upgrade of the fisherman’s vest, which is a classic. The company faced a lawsuit threat from the technology company, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 2002 because of the similarity of the lower case ‘e’ in both of their names and was forced to reduce the similarity.</p><p>The headquarters were moved from Chicago to Ketchum, Idaho, which is the current headquarter. The company again faced a lawsuit from an Idaho Company, Scott USA, in 2004 because of using the company’s trademark word “Scott.” The case was solved when the company joined the words “Scott” and “eVest” into “SCOTTeVest,” which is it’s the current name.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The company is known to manufacture travel clothing that doesn’t look like travel clothing.the clothes are designed in such a way that it helps to reduce the baggage allowance weight and also to restrict space by helping their customers to keep the contents, which they normally store in their carry-on bag, in their specially designed vests with 42 pockets. They designed the clothes in such a way that the weight of the loaded pockets gets distributed evenly so that the garment remains slim and has no bulky appearance.</p><p>They even make unusual clothing such as boxer shorts with pockets for smartphones along with jackets and other outerwear. They even developed a signature design feature of their own inspired by an accident Jordan had with cables of his headphones, which was snagged in his door handle when he was running in the airport. This design consists of channels that help to store wires and flexes to prevent such accidents.</p><p>Their designs consist of the ability to storing flexible detachable solar panels, which are used to charge gadgets with the help of solar energy. They even invented a shirt that helps the customer to recharge their Google Glass with their wearable battery in their shirt. Jordan went to Shark Tank to represent his business on 2nd March 2012, where he didn’t receive any offers, which were less than $1 million.</p><p>On 30th October 2014, Jordan even released his autobiography, entitled Pocket Man: The Unauthorized Autobiography of a Passionate, Personal Promoter. The company faced difficulties when Jordan posted in his social media that the viewers of Fox News are gullible and idiots, and that’s the reason why the company advertised on Fox News. These stirred up controversies, and Jordan was forced to delete the post and issue an apology.</p><p>The workers of the company also found his comments to be impulsive and inappropriate and hence decided to distance themselves from him. But, Jordan had a strong personality, and he even apologized for his wrong deeds and resumed his role as CEO in March 2019.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The company has no awards or achievements in their name currently. But, the company has manufactured some innovative clothing, and their innovative clothing has helped many travelers and military persons. Their role is to provide comfort for their customers and to ease their way of storing their electronic devices. They have helped many people for which they have earned a group of loyal customers.</p><h2>Net Worth of The SCOTTeVEST in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTTeVEST-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The company earlier estimated $10 million in sales from their website alone in December 2013.
