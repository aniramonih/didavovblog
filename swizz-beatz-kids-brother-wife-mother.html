Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys have worked together to build a unified family unit for all the children that they have, and that has positively impacted them all.</p><h2><strong>Swizz Beatz and Alicia Kids Got Married in 2010</strong></h2><p>Hip-hop power couple Alicia Keys and Swizz Beat might not be as famous as Beyoncé and Jay-Z or as loud, but there is definitely no doubt about the huge influence they both wield in the culture. Having met all the way back in the eighties as ambitious teenagers, both of them have risen to take up huge spots in the echelons of Black American music and worldwide as well.</p><p>A fifteen-time Grammy Award winner, Alicia Augello Cook was born in Harlem, New York, on 25 January 1981. Famous for chart-topping singles like ‘No One’, ‘Girl on Fire’, ‘Falling’, ‘My Boo’, and ‘Empire State of Mind’, Alicia has been running the music game for a long time since the release of her first album, Songs in a Mirror in 1991. Nearly forty years and countless awards later, she is happily married to the legendary music producer Swizz Beatz. Swizz is famous for producing the beats for DMX’s trademark spitfire rap bars. He has worked with all the big shots in the industry, including Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Whitney Houston, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Beyoncé</a>, Eve, and many others.</p><p>Swizz and Alicia began seeing each other in 2008, shortly after the former got divorced from his first wife Mashonda. In 2010, they surprised everyone by announcing their engagement. In that same announcement, the couple revealed that they were also expecting their first child together. News like this is usually welcome; however, if there are only mere months between divorce and moving on, it isn’t taken too well by the public. All the blogs were afire with the juicy scandal that gleefully painted Alicia as a husband snatcher, and it certainly didn’t help that things were already awry between her and Mashonda. Not that it deterred the lovers in any way, though.</p><p>On the last day of July 2010, Alicia and Swizz were hitched in holy matrimony at a private wedding ceremony held near the Mediterranean Sea. Fast forward to twelve years later, the ripples appear to have settled. Swizz and Alicia are still as strong as ever, and they have since added one more child to their cute family.</p><h2><strong>How Many Children Do Swizz Beatz and Alicia Kids Have Together?</strong></h2><p>Alicia Keys and her husband are certainly blessed with good looks and talent. They appeared to have passed these blessings onto their two sons, named Egypt and Genesis. Egypt Daoud Dean is the couple’s first son, who was born three months after his parents’ wedding in 2010. Genesis Ali Dean followed four years later, in 2014.</p><h2><strong>Meet Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys’s Children</strong></h2><p>The talented pair are raising quite a brood between them. It’s no new knowledge that Alicia is the proud mother of two boys, but her husband definitely takes the cake when it comes to the number of children they have. Swizz has five kids from 4 different women, staying true to his Muslim belief, which permits polygamy. Apart from his two sons with the famous singer Alicia, he also has other children from his past relationships; two sons and one daughter. This brings the total number of kids in the musical duo to 5.</p><h3><strong>1. Egypt Dean</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Egypt Daoud Dean</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>October 14, 2010</li><li><b><strong>Egypt Daoud Dean’</strong>s Age: </b>13 years old</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Egypt Daoud Dean’s Parents:</strong> Alicia Augello Cook (Alicia Keys) and Kasseem Daoud Dean (Swizz Beats)</li></ul><p>Egypt Daoud Dean is Swizz’s third son and Alicia’s firstborn. He was born on October 14, 2010. He has Jamaican, Puerto Rican, and African American ancestry, courtesy of his multi-ethnic parents. Egypt notably belongs to the Libra Zodiac, a birth sign renowned for its people’s creativity, empathy, and love of balance.</p><p>Fondly called “Egy” by his parents, the young boy is already on his way to being famous, even as a little young man. When he was only five years old, he created and produced a beat from scratch for American rapper Kendrick Lamar. His age has definitely not stopped him in any way. It didn’t keep Egypt from stealing the spotlight from his mother at the iHeart Radio Music Awards in 2019, where he played the piano while she belted her well-known soulful notes. He was not even yet nine years old then, but it was clear to all that the boy was definitely going places.</p><p>His mother has also proudly said that her first child was very good with musical instruments, especially the piano. It’s every parent’s joy to see their children follow their path with as much joy and passion as Egypt has, and we really hope he keeps it up.</p><h3><strong>2. Genesis Dean</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Genesis Ali Dean</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>December 27, 2014</li><li><b><strong>Genesis Ali Dean’s</strong>&nbsp;Age: </b>8 years old<b></b></li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricorns</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Genesis Ali Dean’s Parents:</strong> Alicia Augello Cook (Alicia Keys) and Kasseem Daoud Dean (Swizz Beats)</li></ul><p>Born on 27 December 2014, Keys and Swiss’ second child, Genesis Ali Dean, is not in the public eye as much as his older brother and appears to be much quieter. It really looks like he took his mother’s quiet disposition while his more rambunctious sibling took after his father – a man Keys had once referred to as “ostentatious”.</p><p>Genesis is only 8 years old, and even though he appears to be taking a lot of interest in photography, even assisting his mother during her July 2021 photoshoot for InStyle Cover magazine, all he really wants to do is cuddle up to his mama and play with his older brother – which is incredibly cute.</p><h2><strong>Swizz Beats Children With Other Women</strong></h2><h3><strong>3. Prince Nasir Dean</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Prince Nasir Dean</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>October 25, 2000</li><li><b><strong>Prince Nasir Dean’s</strong>&nbsp;Age: </b>23 years old<b></b></li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Scorpio</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Model, Musician</li><li><strong>Prince Nasir Dean’s Parents:</strong> Nicole Devy and Kasseem Daoud Dean (Swizz Beats)</li></ul><p>Prince is Dean’s first child and son. He was born on the 25th of October, 2000, four years before Dean married singer Mashonda Tifrere. Mashonda wasn’t the mother of this child; however, even though she and Swizz were in a public relationship, Dean had engaged in an illicit affair with a woman named Nicole Devy. The result of that affair was Prince.</p><p>The 23-year-old celebrity child is currently building a career in the modeling industry, as well as pursuing a musical career under the alias Note Marcato.</p><h4><strong>Who Is The Mother of Swizz Beatz’s First Son?</strong></h4><p>According to our findings, Nicole isn’t well known to the public. She was an American media personality who dated Swizz briefly between 1999 and 2000. Nicole Charlene Levy was born on 28 May 1979 in New York City. She is best known as Swizz’s ex-girlfriend and premiere baby mama. Nicole prefers to stay out of the spotlight but co-parents excellently with Swizz and his wife Alicia.</p><h3><strong>4. Kasseem “KJ” Dean Junior</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Kasseem Dean Junior</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>December 2006</li><li><b>Kasseem Dean Junior’s Age: </b>17 Years Old<b></b></li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Sagittarius</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong><b>Kasseem Dean Junior’s</b>&nbsp;Parents:</strong> Mashonda Tifrere and Kasseem Daoud Dean (Swizz Beats)</li></ul><p>Kasseem Dean Jr is Swizz Beatz’s second child and his first with his ex-wife Mashonda. He was born in December 2006 and is currently 17 years old. Dean and Kaseem’s mother, Mashonda Tifrere, became an item in 1998 and dated for almost six years before making their relationship official. They got pregnant with their first child but sadly, the baby was born dead in 2000. Four years later, they got married and welcomed Kaseem in 2006.</p><p>In 2008, the couple announced that they had split with Dean revealing that they had been separated for either nine or ten months as of June 2008. Their marriage was subsequently dissolved officially in May 2010, and the reason given for that was irreconcilable differences.</p><h3><strong>5. Nicole Dean</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full Name: </b>Nicole Dean</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Female</li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b>May 2008</li><li><b>Nicole Dean’s Age: </b>15 Years Old<b></b></li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Taurus</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Nicole Dean’s Parents:</strong> Zhanna Andrianova (Jahna Sabastian) and Kasseem Daoud Dean (Swizz Beats)</li></ul><p>Swizz Beatz’s first and only daughter is also his third overall child. Nicole Dean was born in May 2008 to the record producer, and a certain UK-based German singer named Zhanna Andrianova, who also goes by the stage name Jahna Sabastian. Dean is said to have met the mother of his daughter in 2007, and it turns out that he never knew that Zhanna had a daughter for him until a year after she was born. This was because Jahna chose to keep her pregnancy and the delivery of her daughter away from both Swizz and the public until July 2009. The reason for her decision, she said, was that she did not want her daughter to be dragged into the commotion surrounding her father’s divorce from his ex-wife Mashonda.</p><p>Nicole, who is 15 years old, currently lives in London with her mother, and Swizz gets to see her 3 to 4 times every year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC%2F1qKxs2WSmq61xoykoJ2rXZe%2FsMDHnqlmr5mbsm65zq2fnqpf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html&text=Swizz%20Beatz%20and%20Alicia%20Keys%20are%20Doting%20Parents%20of%205%20Children%2c%20Meet%20Them&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html&title=Swizz%20Beatz%20and%20Alicia%20Keys%20are%20Doting%20Parents%20of%205%20Children%2c%20Meet%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html&title=Swizz%20Beatz%20and%20Alicia%20Keys%20are%20Doting%20Parents%20of%205%20Children%2c%20Meet%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html&title=Swizz%20Beatz%20and%20Alicia%20Keys%20are%20Doting%20Parents%20of%205%20Children%2c%20Meet%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fswizz-beatz-kids-brother-wife-mother.html&description=Swizz%20Beatz%20and%20Alicia%20Keys%20are%20Doting%20Parents%20of%205%20Children%2c%20Meet%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tamar-braxton-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tamar Braxton Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./supreme-patty-net-worth-car-accident-death-real-name.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Supreme Patty Net Worth | Girlfriend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
