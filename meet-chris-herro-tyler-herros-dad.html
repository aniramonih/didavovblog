Being a former basketball player himself, Chris took it upon himself to train his son into becoming one very tough player. Tyler in turn reciprocated his father’s efforts and went on to become the first NBA player born in the 2000s’ to appear in an NBA Conference Final.</p><p><strong>Summary of Chris Herro’s Biography</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Christopher Herro</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> July 11, 1968</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Age:</strong> 55 year old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed Race</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Wife:</strong> Jennifer Herro</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Children:</strong> Tyler Herro, Austin Herro, and Myles Herro</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Height in Inches:</strong> 70 Inches</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 178 cm</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Weight:</strong> 95 kg (209 lbs)</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Net Worth:</strong> $1 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Tyler Herro’s Father</li><li><strong>Chris Herro’s Instagram:</strong> @chris_herro</li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> @ChrisHerro</li></ul><h2><strong>Chris Herro Was Born in Florida</strong></h2><p>Christopher Herro was born on July 11, 1968, in Florida to parents who were not public figures and so very little is known about their identities and occupations. There is also no mention of any other children they might have had apart from Christopher.</p><p>Chris himself is American and is of mixed ethnicity. Still, his true heritage remains a close secret as he has refused to reveal his root. When he was still young, Chris Herro and his family moved from Florida to Wisconsin where he has lived to date.</p><p>There have been plenty of conversations about Tyler’s true ethnic mix and naturally, folks have looked to his parents for some clues. It seems that Tyler’s mother is hundred percent Caucasian.</p><p>Looking at Chris Herro, though, one would see what looks like some Asian or Hispanic features. However, extensive internet research shows that the surname “Herro” is not of Asian origin. All clues seem to point towards Spain, Switzerland, Germany, and the Philippines.</p><p>Chris Herro attended Nathan Hale High School, a public school located in West Allis, Wisconsin, on Lincoln Avenue and South 116th Street. He graduated from this high school in 1986 at the age of 18. He then went to Florida State College where he played basketball for the school team.</p><p>As a young boy, Chris was very athletic and it’s obvious that that is where his son gets his sports genes from. His Twitter bio describes him as a father of 3, Navy veteran, Libertarian, Christian, Packers, Brewers, Badgers fan, and a Dog lover.</p><h2><strong>Tyler Herro’s Dad is a Business Owner</strong></h2><p>At the moment, Chris Herro is the owner of a home service business called Superior Disposal. The company provides home-related building services like snow plowing, concrete contracting, and roofing.</p><p>It is not hard to see that Chris is quite comfortable financially, as his business remains in demand all year round. Still, the father-of-three had very different plans for his career when he was much younger.</p><p>Chris Herro wanted the career his son now has—a professional basketball player. He worked and trained in the sport as a teenager and young adult, and was regarded as one of the best players in the Wisconsin area.</p><p>His NBA dreams were, however, cut short after he reportedly suffered an ACL injury. This resulted in him losing a sports scholarship that was meant to advance his career.&nbsp; He ended up losing his prior offers from Saint Louis and Florida State.</p><p>When asked about how he took the blow to his career, Chris admitted that it took him a very long while to get over the disappointment. This was because he was not only a good player, but he was also very passionate about the game. And so it was a tough pill to swallow, as he was forced to direct his passions into something entirely different.</p><p>Nonetheless, the celebrity dad has made lemonade out of the bitter lemons life threw at him, thanks to the successful career of his son.</p><h2><strong>Chris Herro is Currently Married To Jennifer Herro</strong></h2><p>Chris is a happily married man. The former basketballer is married to a woman named Jennifer Herro, popularly called Jenn. They met each other while they were both athletes in college.</p><p>They got married in 1999, about 24 years ago, in Greenfield. Chris was 31 years old at the time. They welcomed their first child, son Tyler, in January 2000 and went on to have two more sons named Austin and Myles Herro.</p><h2><strong>Chris Herro was His Son’s First Basketball Coach</strong></h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/09/Herro-family.jpg alt="Chris Herro" width=696 height=437 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Remember when we said that Chris had to give up basketball due to his injury? Well, it seems like he didn’t give up the sport entirely, but decided to coach his son instead. According to Tyler, he began throwing hoops as early as 6 years old.</p><p>The NBA player has also admitted that his father was his most significant influence. This was nothing but the truth as Chris not only taught his son to play but also coached him on his attitude to the game. As a result of this, Tyler developed confidence much bigger than himself.</p><p>Chris is credited with teaching Tyler how to be confident in himself and his skills as well as to ignore the naysayers. One of the instances when Tyler’s tough skin saved him was when he transferred to Kentucky from Wisconsin.</p><p>That move was followed by a series of death threats and intense bullying, and Tyler would have fallen apart had it not been for his father’s teachings. Now Tyler’s strong work ethic and cocky attitude have become his trademark on the court.</p><h3><strong>Despite Their Close Bond, Chris and His Son are Said to Have a Love-Hate Relationship</strong></h3><p>Chris Herro’s wife, Jen has spoken of the times when she and her husband were at loggerheads, and 9 times out of 10, it was related to their son. She said that sometimes she believed that Chris pushed Tyler too hard. However, Tyler has accepted his father’s methods and said he has no regrets about them. The player admitted that it was tough in the beginning, but in the end, everything paid off.</p><p>As for Chris himself, he says that he never forgot that under the athlete was a son—his son. Chris also knows when and how to show empathy to Tyler when he needs it. The two men appear to have smoothed out the roughest part of their relationship and get along pretty well these days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmmqGqmah6qbHRq6ZmrKmhsrN5x56pq6ejYrGisI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html&text=Meet%20Chris%20Herro%2c%20Tyler%20Herros%20Dad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Herro%2c%20Tyler%20Herros%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Herro%2c%20Tyler%20Herros%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html&title=Meet%20Chris%20Herro%2c%20Tyler%20Herros%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-chris-herro-tyler-herros-dad.html&description=Meet%20Chris%20Herro%2c%20Tyler%20Herros%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ernestine-sclafani.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet-Ernestine Scalfani, the wife of sports commentator Skip Bayless.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./charity-lawson-siblings-david-nehemiah-amiyaka.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Charity Lawson Siblings David, Nehemiah and Amiyaka: Family Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
