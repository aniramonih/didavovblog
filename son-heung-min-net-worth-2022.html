When Son was an FC Seoul young player, he worked as a ball boy for a home match in 2008. Lee Chung-Yong, a Crystal Palace and Bolton Wanderers midfielder was his role model at the time.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CdHZDy1K-Vc/</p><p>Son speaks Korean, German, and English in addition to his native tongue.

His father worked hard to educate him and instill in him a sense of ambition and hunger. In 2008, he joined Hamburger SV’s youth setup after breaking through with the South Korean squad.</p><p>He was assigned to FC Seoul in the next season. He, on the other hand, saw it as a learning experience rather than a setback. Hamburger SV called him back after he performed admirably. In 2010, he made his senior debut for the German club and went on to play 78 games for them.</p><p>Bayer Leverkusen noticed his amazing progress in Germany and signed him in 2013. In just one season at the German club, he secured a starting spot in the squad. In 87 appearances across two years with the club, he scored 29 goals and added 11 assists. During his second season with the German club, he drew strong interest from Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur.</p><p>He was signed by the Spurs in 2015. He has been a top performer on the English team since then. He scored four goals and added one assist in his first season.</p><p>He began breathing fire from his boot as soon as he relaxed with the crew. In 308 games, he has 117 goals and 69 assists to his credit.</p><p>He has already established himself as a major character at the club. Even though he was out for the whole 2021/22 season due to an unexpected injury, he still managed to be the team’s leading scorer.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Roger Staubach Net Worth 2022: Income And Earning Of Richest Cowboys Player!" href=# rel=bookmark>Roger Staubach Net Worth 2022: Income And Earning Of Richest Cowboys Player!</a></p><h2><strong>Son Heung-min International Career</strong></h2><p>Son has been a part of the national team since he was a teenager.

Son Woong-Jung, his father, was a member of the national team when he was younger. From his adolescence, his father oversaw his training sessions.

Heung-Yun Son, his older brother, is also a musician.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Rich Paul Net Worth 2022: Biography, Career, Girlfriend Adele And Everything You Need To Know!" href=# rel=bookmark>Rich Paul Net Worth 2022: Biography, Career, Girlfriend Adele And Everything You Need To Know!</a></p><h2><strong>Son Heung-min Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Heung-min is presently single.
