During the same sessions he worked on a follow-up Lennon/Ono album, Milk and Honey, but Lennon's murder on December 8, 1980 cut that project short. An unfinished version of the album was released in 1984. Douglas was later involved in litigation with Ono over unpaid royalties from Double Fantasy.</p><p>The close relationship between Douglas and Aerosmith extended beyond producing and engineering, as Douglas was also a musical contributor to the group when they came up short of material on their projects. For example, Douglas helped write the band's 1978 hit "Kings and Queens". He was often given the nickname of "the sixth member" of Aerosmith, due to his close relationship with the band. Douglas was replaced as producer by the band for the 1979 release Night in the Ruts, but Douglas was to again work with the group on 1982's Rock in a Hard Place and several of Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry's solo albums. For much of the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, Aerosmith worked with other producers, but in the mid-2000s, they re-united with Douglas on the 2004 blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo. Douglas also produced the band's album Music from Another Dimension! in 2012, himself providing the narration on the album's opening track "LUV XXX", parodying the style of narration from The Outer Limits.</p><p>A chance encounter with a group member led Douglas to help engineer the Who's 1971 Record Plant sessions for the aborted Lifehouse project. Songs developed from these sessions were later included on Who's Next (1971). Douglas was then given the opportunity to engineer John Lennon's classic Imagine album in 1971. Douglas and Lennon formed a close bond and worked together for the remainder of Lennon's life.</p><p>Jack Douglas is an American record producer. He is known for his work with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Cheap Trick, and the New York Dolls, among other rock artists in the 1970s and 1980s; notably he produced three successful albums for Aerosmith.</p><p>Douglas engineered and produced many of Aerosmith's albums in the 1970s, including Get Your Wings (1974), Toys in the Attic (1975), Rocks (1976) and Draw the Line (1977), all of which have gone multi-platinum. Toys in the Attic and Rocks broke Aerosmith into the mainstream and have become highly influential, with both albums ranking among Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p><p>Starting out as a folk musician and performer, he worked on Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 senatorial campaign as a songwriter. Douglas then moved to England and joined a succession of bands before returning to New York to attend the Institute of Audio Research.</p><p>Jack Douglas was born in the Bronx in 1947, New York City. He was trained at the Institute of Audio Research and was a member of its first graduating class.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrqxe8mamqRllKTCqLjArGSrnZOkv6V5z6umna2Tmr8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html&text=Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html&title=Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html&title=Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html&title=Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjack-douglas-record-producer.html&description=Jack%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jersey-shore-star-snooki-claims-her-latest-breakdown-on-family-vacation-is-all-lies-313330.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jersey Shore Star Snooki Claims Her Latest Breakdown On Family Vacation Is All Lies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-fisher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Sarah Fisher Married To Boyfriend, Anthony Head?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
