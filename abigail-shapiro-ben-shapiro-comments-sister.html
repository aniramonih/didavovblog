The <a href=# rel>right-wing firebrand</a>, who is frequently seen on YouTube embroiled in heated discussions with liberals, was accused of allegedly fawning over his sister and attacked over his <a href=# rel>conservative beliefs</a>.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Ben Shapiro has the last laugh as the student says he's ONLY 5'5, then stands next to him</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Candace Owens mocked for 'going off script' by praising Super Bowl halftime show</a></p><p>Two fake tweets made the rounds on social media, appearing to suggest that Shapiro had a thing for his sister. "The thing with homosexuality and transgenderism is that it simply boils down to exerting control over your impulses. Like, say you have a hot sister. You fantasize about it, maybe you steal her underwear a couple of times, but it goes no further than that," one fake tweet read. Another fake tweet appeared to show Shapiro appreciating his sister's looks. "Look how beautiful my sister looks. Simply glowing. I've literally been staring at these photos for hours," it read.</p><p>Critics of Shapiro pounced on the opportunity to slam his conservative views and beliefs. "This now-deleted tweet of Ben Shapiro, who's probably talking about his younger sister Abby, makes me look at him with pity and disgust.&nbsp;"Find someone who looks at you like Ben Shapiro looks at his sister," said another troll.</p><p>"Ben Shapiro, why would you want Twitter to know you have a thing for your sister? Is this the place where you, and Charlie Kirk go to work out your sexual frustrations?" said another troll. One said, "It's glorious when the weasels out themselves. @benshapiro is just sick.

According to her website, she "found" herself "at a loss" after finishing college at the University of Southern California and the Manhattan School of Music as she "left behind" her traditional values. Abigail and Ben, whose parents are Eri and Michelle Shapiro, have another sister named Milly Shapiro and they hail from an orthodox Jewish family. The siblings were exposed to music at a young age -- Abigail is known for her singing skills, while Ben aced the violin when he was as young as 12 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZKetKK1y2aqoZmgnr%2BwecGepWarmJa9qr7OZpqopZ2au7W%2FjKygrKyVpw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html&text=Who%20is%20Abigail%20Shapiro%3f%20Ben%20Shapiro%20trolled%20for%20bizarre%20comments%20about%20sister...%20but%20are%20they%20REAL%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html&title=Who%20is%20Abigail%20Shapiro%3f%20Ben%20Shapiro%20trolled%20for%20bizarre%20comments%20about%20sister...%20but%20are%20they%20REAL%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html&title=Who%20is%20Abigail%20Shapiro%3f%20Ben%20Shapiro%20trolled%20for%20bizarre%20comments%20about%20sister...%20but%20are%20they%20REAL%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html&title=Who%20is%20Abigail%20Shapiro%3f%20Ben%20Shapiro%20trolled%20for%20bizarre%20comments%20about%20sister...%20but%20are%20they%20REAL%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabigail-shapiro-ben-shapiro-comments-sister.html&description=Who%20is%20Abigail%20Shapiro%3f%20Ben%20Shapiro%20trolled%20for%20bizarre%20comments%20about%20sister...%20but%20are%20they%20REAL%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-babyface-sister-brothers-kevon-and-melvin-edmonds-and-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is BabyFace Sister | Brothers Kevon And Melvin Edmonds And Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lucille-ball-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Lucille Ball's Kids?
