On September 3, 1987, Spikes was born in Shelby, North Carolina. He also played football for the Crest Chargers and was a standout player for Crest High School in Shelby. Spikes turned down offers from numerous other universities in favor of a sports scholarship from the University of Florida.</strong></p><p>While playing college football for the Florida Gators, he was a member of two BCS National Championship teams and was named an All-American. The New England Patriots selected Brandon in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft. In addition, he played for the Buffalo Bills.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Is Brandon Spike’s Brother, Breyon Middlebrooks, In Jail? Update 2023</span></h2><p>Regarding his parents or personal life, Brandon Spikes has not disclosed anything. On the other hand, Breyon Middlebrooks and his mother Sherry Allen raised him. Similarly, the brother of the former American football linebacker was convicted of both murder and drug trafficking. Breyon was also taken into custody for those offenses in 2003.</p><p>After a hung jury in his first murder trial, Middlebrooks was found guilty in a retrial in 2003. Similarly, in 2005, an appeal was filed, but it was denied. Furthermore, Middlebrooks admitted to being present at the drug transaction scene, but he maintained that he was not the shooter and that the murder was an accident. When his brother was incarcerated at Scotland Correctional Institute in Laurinburg, North Carolina, Middlebrooks would watch him play every game.</p><p>Despite his criminal record, Breyon can be remembered as a kind sibling who supported his younger sibling through trying times. Breyon remains incarcerated, facing a life sentence for the homicide case. More details about him are currently unclear, though.</p><p>Similarly, other sources claim that despite knowing that there is little likelihood of reversing the sentence, Brandon frequently talks on the phone with his brother, Breyon. Even now, Breyon’s incarceration inspires his brother to succeed and stay on course. Moreover, according to certain websites, Spikes followed his jailed brother’s counsel and went back to Florida to concentrate on his game.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>More About Brandon Spikes</span></h2><p>Brandon is from a family that struggles financially. On the other hand, his fame came from his talent and persistence. His career seems to be similar to that of any other high school athlete. Conversely, spikes had particular, distinctive qualities. He was the standout football player for the Crest Chargers at Shelby’s Crest High School. Spikes was considered one of the top prospects for high school linebackers in the nation.</p><p>Later, Brandon got accepted to the University of Florida on an athletic scholarship. He was a member of Urban Meyer’s Florida Gators football team from 2006 to 2009. The New England Patriots, who selected him in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft, marked the beginning of his professional career. Spikes signed a four-year deal with the Patriots and became an inside linebacker starter right away.</p><p>Brandon signed a one-year deal with the Buffalo Bills after leaving the Patriots, but he was penalized $8,268 for a late hit against the Chicago Bears. In addition, Spikes’ contract was terminated by the Patriots because of a police inquiry, even though he was expected to return for a one-year extension. Right now, Brandon’s life is not focused on the football field. On the other hand, he uses his social media accounts to share news about the teams he used to play for all the time.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Smolsprout</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Mercado</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>professional linebacker</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Patrick Christys | Wife: GB News Presenter Married Alex Lingwood</a></h3>Patrick Christys might be well known to news consumers.
