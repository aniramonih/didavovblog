In the match, Storm was defeated by <a href=#>Matt Hardy</a>, managed by Reby Sky.</p><p>When Hyatt left ECW, she still worked for various independent promotions. She has worked for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU) at all of their events in New Jersey since April 2007. She often hosts her interview segment, Missy's Manor.</p><p>Hyatt returned to managing in 1993, with an association with The Nasty Boys. She also briefly managed The Barbarian. During a match, Hyatt jumped off the ring apron and her breast popped out of her top. When she went to the WCW offices the next day, they allegedly had a blown-up picture of it on the wall. Hyatt complained to her boss at the time, <a href=#>Eric Bischoff</a>. Bischoff did not take action, so Hyatt went over his head, to his boss. As a result, Bischoff released her. She then decided to file a lawsuit against WCW for sexual harassment, and for overdue payments for her time doing a 1-900 hotline for the company. Bischoff, however, claimed that Hyatt was fired on February 8, for her behavior and jealousy over the signing of <a href=#>Sherri Martel</a>.</p><p>In 1987, when the UWF was purchased by the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions, Missy and Eddie came along. Missy was used as a commentator, conducting her debut interview with Sir <a href=#>Oliver Humperdink</a> on the December 31, 1988 edition of World Championship Wrestling on TBS, and then eventually as the manager for Gilbert and The Steiner Brothers. She eventually returned to her role as commentator and hosted WCW Main Event, and soon was engaged in a feud with fellow commentator, Paul E. Dangerously. The feud led to various competitions between the two, including an arm wrestling match at the Clash of the Champions XIV: Dixie Dynamite on January 30, 1991, in which Hyatt defeated Dangerously. A contributing factor to her victory might be that Hyatt had removed her jacket to reveal her low-cut top as the ref started the contest. Missy would engage in a battle over who the "First Lady of WCW" was with The Dangerous Alliance's Madusa, with Hyatt narrowly winning a Bikini Showdown at the 1992 Beach Blast pay-per-view event. While in WCW Hyatt made an appearance in the IWA at ringside during a match between The Bushwhackers and The Thunderfoots.</p><p>Eventually, Hyatt and Tatum left for the Universal Wrestling Federation. At this time, <a href=#>Eddie Gilbert</a> was the leader of "Hot Stuff International," a group that included Sting and <a href=#>Rick Steiner</a>. Hyatt formed an alliance with his group and it was renamed "H & H International, Inc". It was not long before Hyatt and Gilbert started an affair that caused problems with Tatum. Hyatt left Tatum for Gilbert in 1987, and they split up on screen as well. She married Gilbert in 1988.</p><p>While still under UWF contract, Hyatt was contacted about working for the World Wrestling Federation. Vince McMahon wanted Hyatt to replace Rowdy <a href=#>Roddy Piper</a> and his segment, Piper's Pit, with a new segment called "Missy's Manor." "Missy's Manor" segments were taped on March 21 and 22, and April 23, 1987. Despite having big name stars on her segment such as "Macho Man" <a href=#>Randy Savage</a> with <a href=#>Miss Elizabeth</a>, <a href=#>The Honky Tonk Man</a> and <a href=#>Harley Race</a>, the show was considered a disappointment, and McMahon asked Hyatt to become a Federette, which were the ring girls shown at pay-per-views. She thought the role was beneath her, and she went back to the UWF.</p><p>Hyatt's professional wrestling career began in 1985 when she was hired by World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). She was the manager of <a href=#>John Tatum</a>, whom she was dating at the time. She was embroiled in a feud with another valet in WCCW, Sunshine. This rivalry culminated into a mud-pit match at Texas Stadium in 1986.</p><p>Melissa Ann Hiatt (born October 16, 1963) is an American professional wrestling valet, better known by her ring name, Missy Hyatt. She gained the majority of her fame working for World Championship Wrestling, before joining Extreme Championship Wrestling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfora0v9hmn7KZpKk%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmissy-hyatt.html&text=Missy%20Hyatt%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmissy-hyatt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmissy-hyatt.html&title=Missy%20Hyatt%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmissy-hyatt.html&title=Missy%20Hyatt%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmissy-hyatt.html&title=Missy%20Hyatt%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmissy-hyatt.html&description=Missy%20Hyatt%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./miya-cech.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miya Cech">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./missy-elliott-illness.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Missy Elliott Illness: What Happened to the Rap Icon?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
