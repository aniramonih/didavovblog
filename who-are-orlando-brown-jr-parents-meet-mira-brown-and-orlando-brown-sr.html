They gave birth to him on May 2nd 1996, and he has gone on to become an exceptional NFL offensive tackle.</strong></p><p>While Orlando Brown Sr. Played active football as an offensive tackle and later earned a living as a restaurant owner, nothing is known about his wife’s career endeavors. Sadly, the senior Orlando died in 2011 after suffering from the clinical condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><h2><strong>Meet Orlando Brown Jr.’s&nbsp; Parents</strong></h2><p>The parents of NFL offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. have been revealed as Orlando Brown Sr. and his wife, Mira Brown.</p><h2><strong>Orlando Brown Sr. was a Washington, D.C. Native</strong></h2><p>Orlando Brown Sr. hails from Washington, D.C. in the United States. Born in 1970, he spent a better part of his growing-up years in the country’s capital. The patriarch of the Brown family was an American citizen with African-American ethnic background. Due to the fact that his son,&nbsp;Orlando Brown Jr, has never mentioned anything about him, it is not known whether he had siblings or grew up as an only child.</p><p>Information about Brown Sr.’s early academic background is not known, but it is known that he attended H.D. Woodson Senior High School. According to reports, he played football during his days as a high school student.</p><p>The quest for further academic qualifications took the senior Orlando to South Carolina State University. However, his course of study and year of graduation are not known. The only known fact about his university days is that he was very active in the football club of his college, playing in the position of an offensive tackle.</p><h3><strong>Orlando Brown Sr. Played Football at Professional Level</strong></h3><p>After he completed his studies at South Carolina State University, the senior Orlando hoped to be drafted into the National Football League but it wasn’t forthcoming. In 1993, he eventually decided to launch his football career as an undrafted free agent.</p><p>This decision led him to ink a deal with the Cleveland Browns of the NFL where he played for three seasons in the Offensive tackle position. From the Browns, he moved to the Baltimore Ravens and continued his exploits in the same football position.</p><p>During his active days as a football player, Orlando Brown Jr.’s father was quite formidable in the field of play. He earned a reputation for being an intimidating and energetic player. He had an awesome 2 meters, 360 lbs. frame, leading his colleagues to nickname him Zeus during his prime.</p><h4><strong>His Post Football Career</strong></h4><p>The senior Orlando played active football for several seasons before taking the conscious decision to retire. He went into the hospitality industry as a restaurateur afterwards.</p><p>In his city, Maryland, Orlando takes the credit for establishing the first Fatburger franchise. There are no reports on how well the restaurant business fared but that was what the former football player did until passed on.</p><p>It’s important to note that Orlando Brown Sr. had a brush with the authorities at a point in his life. It happened that he was charged to court for offenses bothering on property destruction and third-degree burglary in September 2009. However, in the absence of enough evidence to prove his guilt, the case was eventually struck out.</p><h3><strong>Orlando Brown Jr. was Inspired by His Late Dad</strong></h3><p>Orlando Brown Sr. is among the major reasons his son, Orlando Brown Jr. is now playing with the Kansas City Chiefs football team of the National Football League.</p><p>The junior Brown’s reasons for leaving the Ravens stemmed from the player’s wish to play left tackle in the National Football League. However, he came to understand that it won’t be possible for him to play in that position after the Baltimore Ravens signed on left tackle Ronnie Stanley in October and the deal was a multi-year extension.</p><p>Following this development, Orlando Brown Jr. took to his Twitter handle to talk about his wish to play on the left side permanently. According to the tweet he dropped, he wanted to be able to live out his father’s dreams for him.</p><p>In pursuit of his dreams, the Junior Orlando went all out to seek a team that would acquire him to play permanently on the left, and as luck would have it, The Kansas Chiefs needed a franchise-caliber left tackle and the rest is history.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s never been about the money. I’m so appreciative for this organization and all my teammates. I couldn’t thank DeCosta enough, he’s a incredible football mind and one the best men I know. I want to live out the dream my dad had for me. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/JhHj4PL2mG</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bbki7zO9Vb</a></p><p>— Orlando Brown Jr. (@ZEUS__57) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2021</a></p><h3><strong>Orland Brown Jr.’s Father Died in 2011</strong></h3><p>Orlando Brown Jr. was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis. The condition usually occurs as a result of inadequate insulin and high blood sugar levels.</p><p>He lived with the condition for a short while before he passed on. The senior Orlando’s body was found lifeless in his Baltimore residence on the 23rd of September 2011 and he was 40 at the time of his demise.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding his death led the state medical examiner to conduct an autopsy which proved beyond doubt that he really died from the complications of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>Following his father’s demise, the junior Orlando joined effort with the globe’s largest type one diabetes research network, TrialNet, in raising awareness about the prevention of the disease.</p><p>According to findings, relatives of victims of type 1 diabetes are 15 times more likely to end up with the condition. In fact, one of Orlando’s brothers developed the disease in fifth grade, and now that he is a father, the offensive tackle feels the need to create awareness about screening and prevention research on type 1 diabetics.</p><p>So far, Orlando Brown Jr. has succeeded in linking more than 225,000 relatives of type 1 diabetes victims and they have participated in screening and studies on TrialNet.</p><h2><strong>Who is Orlando Brown Jr.’s Mother?</strong></h2><p>Orlando Brown Jr.’s mother is quite unlike his father as nothing much is known about her. It’s only known that she is called, Mira Brown and nothing else. Her professional life is not known and it is also not known whether she remarried after being widowed in 2011.</p><h2><strong>Were Orland Brown Sr. and Mira Brown Married when They had Their Son?</strong></h2><p>It is a common fact that Orlando Brown Jr. was born on the 2nd of May 1996 but the details of his parents’ wedding are not available. Thus, it is not possible to tell whether they had him after marriage or out of wedlock.</p><p>The junior Orlando is not the only child born to his parents, he grew up alongside four siblings – two sisters and two brothers. However, nothing is known about any of them but they are said to be all grown up and forging their own paths in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yaqZ5ln6e5orrDqGSbqp%2Bsu2620WanmqqVo8G0ecyenK1lnZ6%2FonnBq6awpl2Wu6V5zqujmqaUpHqjvs6wpWaromQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html&text=Who%20are%20Orlando%20Brown%20Jr.%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Mira%20Brown%20And%20Orlando%20Brown%20Sr.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html&title=Who%20are%20Orlando%20Brown%20Jr.%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Mira%20Brown%20And%20Orlando%20Brown%20Sr." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html&title=Who%20are%20Orlando%20Brown%20Jr.%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Mira%20Brown%20And%20Orlando%20Brown%20Sr." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html&title=Who%20are%20Orlando%20Brown%20Jr.%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Mira%20Brown%20And%20Orlando%20Brown%20Sr." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-orlando-brown-jr-parents-meet-mira-brown-and-orlando-brown-sr.html&description=Who%20are%20Orlando%20Brown%20Jr.%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Mira%20Brown%20And%20Orlando%20Brown%20Sr." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-caroline-fleming-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Caroline Fleming Dating Now?
