She admitted to it. She also said this is why she couldn’t see him as a patient anymore and so Charles understood her dilemma. He knows they can no longer see each other in a professional sense. Only he doesn’t really want a new therapist. He talked to Sharon about it and he told his friend that changing therapists isn’t the same as changing sneakers. He was going to need time before he went looking again. He got a referral from his former therapist. He now who to reach out to in a crisis. He just needed to take his time before he committed to anything or anyone else. And Sharon understood that.</p><p>Sharon had forgotten her cell phone in her car. She went back out to collect it and she was coming into the hospital when she witnessed a car accident. She saw a woman collide into the stone barrier. The woman called for help after the accident. She was taken into the hospital and she was being treated by one of the people that had found her alongside Sharon. The doctor’s name is Shentu. He was the Chief Complaint Officer. He mostly wears suits instead of scrubs and so not everyone took it well when Sharon asked him to stay on the case. The Chief of the ED thought Shentu should stay in his suit.</p><p>Archer even told Taylor to keep Shentu’s interactions with the patients brief. He didn’t want the guy around any longer than necessary and yet it was a good thing that Shentu treated Gia Lindell. She survived covid only to get fibromyalgia. It’s a condition that meant she was in incredible pain and there was no cure for it. They were treatments. Some of them were off-label meds and so it’s a good thing that Shentu had been the one to suggest them because normally he’s the guy that’s telling the doctors not to use off-label meds. He orders them not to. Only things were different with him on the ground because now he sees the patients and not the numbers.</p><p>Elsewhere in the hospital, Hammer found out that her mother committed herself. She always knew her mother struggled with mental health and she was never able to convince her mother to get help because the woman refused to see that she was sick. Terri was also an alcoholic. This combined with her mental health meant she was often homeless and so was her daughter. This was why Hammer was at first happy that her mother had gotten help. She went up to the psych ward to see what finally convinced her mother to get help when she realized that her mother hadn’t contacted her at all while she was seeking treatment.</p><p>Terri got help. She just never reached out to her daughter and if anything she further her own child away. Here was Hammer worried about what her move could mean for her mother, but it’s clear that her mother sees her as an impediment to her wellbeing and so Hammer got angry. She let that anger out on Charles because she feels he should have told her about her mother when she knows darn well that he couldn’t. There were rules about this. Charles couldn’t take about his patient’s health without her permission and he didn’t have her permission to speak to her daughter. Hammer only found out her mother was being treated by one of the nurses telling her.</p><p>The nurse had thought Hammer knew. She even congratulated Hammer on her mother being released and so that explained why Hammer couldn’t get into contact with her mother for weeks. But it doesn’t explain why her mother kept her in the dark. Hammer had to let that one go and she wasn’t the only one. Shentu realized that his guidelines were too stringent so he was relaxing the rules. It turns out this was Sharon’s plan all along. Sharon asked him to stay on the case because she wanted him to see the real costs of his initiatives. She had hoped it would wake him up and it did. He decided to relax the rules.</p><p>Shentu was even relaxing the rules about interoffice dating. Taylor had asked him out after their shift and he agreed to it because it turns out he was interested in her too. The interoffice dating thing however wasn’t going to work for Crockett. He explained to both mother and daughter that he wasn’t seeing them at the same time. Only it opened Blake’s eyes. She realizes she shouldn’t be dating Crockett and she told him that what they had was over. It’s over between them. They were better off as coworkers. They later helped transplant a piece of a father’s liver into his daughter and the surgery had been tricky.</p><p>Maggie also heard back from her doctor that the biopsy they took of the mass in her womb wasn’t cancerous. Not that it was going to stop her fear of cancer one day coming back.</p><p>Hammer met with her mom at her mom’s new apartment and it was good to see her mother. Terri had apparently gone to the hospital herself after she feared she would harm herself and she was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She’s on meds now. She isn’t living on the street. She also wasn’t self-medicating with booze. Terri was in a good place and Hammer later got to see that for herself. And so she felt at ease about moving away.</p><p>And Scott treated his old friend Terrell and he learned that Terrell can’t read. It would explain why he dropped out of school at seventeen.</p><p>THE END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnk522pK3GqGSmnZRiv6avwKlkaWtdZX9ufpFmqp6Zo6S7boOMnqeiq5%2BZsm59k2aYpaRdqbWmedOhoKefo2LBqa3TZpqorZyZeqmt1Z5km52Vo3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html&text=Chicago%20Med%20Recap%2003%2f02%2f22%3a%20Season%207%20Episode%2014%20All%20The%20Things%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html&title=Chicago%20Med%20Recap%2003%2f02%2f22%3a%20Season%207%20Episode%2014%20All%20The%20Things%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html&title=Chicago%20Med%20Recap%2003%2f02%2f22%3a%20Season%207%20Episode%2014%20All%20The%20Things%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html&title=Chicago%20Med%20Recap%2003%2f02%2f22%3a%20Season%207%20Episode%2014%20All%20The%20Things%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchicago-med-recap-03-02-22-season-7-episode-14-all-the-things-that-could-have-been.html&description=Chicago%20Med%20Recap%2003%2f02%2f22%3a%20Season%207%20Episode%2014%20All%20The%20Things%20That%20Could%20Have%20Been" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./clothing-or-apparel-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clothing or apparel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebs-who-were-released-from-jail-and-made-a-comeback.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebs Who Were Released From Jail And Made A Comeback">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
