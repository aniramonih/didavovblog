And when it comes to astrology, there are three<strong> </strong>zodiac signs that are more likely to have <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>narcissistic<strong> </strong>personality traits</a><strong> </strong>than<strong> </strong>the rest, simply due to characteristics often associated with the sign.</p><p>Each zodiac sign comes with its fair share of positive qualities, as well as a few negatives. After all, to have good sides and bad sides is what it is to be human. But if a certain trait seems to be holding a person back in life — such as a tendency to be a bit self-absorbed — it can be helpful to figure out why that is, and make a few simple changes.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# class=T3D>Aries Zodiac Signs: Personality Traits, Love Compatibility & More Astrology</a></p><p>"It's important to have a healthy self-esteem. But it's [also] important to look closely, and see whether or not our healthy self-esteem isn't really overcompensation to <a href=# class=T3D>hide deep-rooted insecurity,</a>" <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>life coach and astrologer Joshua MacGuire</a> tells Bustle. "It's good to have a look at our possible character defects to create our best selves. If people want more happiness in life, self-awareness is the first step."</p><p><i>Read more: </i><a href=# class=T3D><i>Leo Zodiac Signs: Personality Traits, Love Compatibility, & More Astrology</i></a></p><p>That being said, it's always essential to remember that not everyone will identify completely with their sign. Although different zodiac signs have different attributes, not all characteristics may pertain to you. Instead, the zodiac should be used as a guide to help with self-reflection, and offer further insights into the qualities you <i>do </i>identify with.</p><p><i>Read more: </i><a href=# class=T3D><i>Capricorn Zodiac Signs: Personality Traits, Love Compatibility, & More Astrology</i></a></p><p>Even though these signs may be a bit vain at times, that doesn't mean they're bad people or that they can't improve. Here, MacGuire offers some insight, as well as what each of these <a href=# class=T3D>signs can do to rein in their selfish moments</a>, and be a bit more self-aware.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Aries (March 21 - April 19)</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Tina Gong/Bustle</p></figure><p>If an Aries seems like they're being narcissistic, there's usually a good reason why. "[...] Aries [might] <a href=#>have abandonment issues</a>, as if they've chosen this to force their self-creation," MacGuire says. "If they don't assert an identity all their own, the underlying belief would be that they had deserved to be abandoned, which isn't true. They have to be self-focused to <a href=#>create their identity in the world</a>, or create a new world in which they can stand up, be special, and be counted. Sometimes this self-focus, however, can be taken to an extreme, resulting in an unwillingness or inability to consider the thoughts and feelings of others. This lack of empathy can make Aries [seem] narcissistic."</p><p>But since there's an easily-pinpointed explanation for any selfishness they may display, it makes it all the easier for Aries to turn things around. "If Aries can <a href=#>increase their internal sense of self-worth</a>, they can help others do the same. In helping to heal others fears of abandonment, they can assuage their own," MacGuire says.</p><p>Aries can also reach out to others for help, too. "Aries can aim to find relationships in which they share a mutual empathy with others. Once they realize we're all in this together, Aries can find a lot of joy in caring for other people. When Aries teaches others what they wish they had known, they can <a href=#>be the leader this world needs</a>."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Leo (July 23 - August 22)</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Tina Gong/Bustle</p></figure><p>Leo is ruled by the Sun, the center of our solar system. And as such they may like to be the center of attention. "Their job is to take center stage and show us all <a href=#>the power of self-expression</a>," MacGuire says. "Sometimes, however, this can result in an overinflated sense of self-importance."</p><p>That's why, when things don't go their way, their emotions can flare up. "Perceiving themselves as coming from a position of lack, when anything gets in their way of rising — if someone says 'no' or shoots them down — Leo can be destructive," MacGuire says. This can come in the form of fighting with those they perceived to have shut them down says MacGuire, or possibly seeking reprisal for their hurt feelings — all of which are ways Leo <a href=#>can seem to be narcissistic</a>.</p><p>But since it never feels good to be that angry, Leo can stand to <a href=#>find better ways of coping</a> with any slights (or perceived slights) they might encounter in life. "They have to reach a stage of confidence in which they don't take things personally. They also have to accept that other people's feelings and preferences matter, too, and blowing a gasket when denied is only going to make people ... less inclined to respect them," MacGuire says.</p><p>While it may be tricky at first, adjusting their viewpoint has so many benefits. "They want their audience to consist of strong, stand-up people ... If Leo <a href=#>wants to be in the best company</a>, they should be poised to treat other people with the same respect to which they feel entitled." Once they can do that, Leo will be able to get all the attention they love and need — in a healthier way.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Capricorn (December 22 - January 19</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Tina Gong/Bustle</p></figure><p>Capricorn might come off as selfish for two reasons. First, "their sign correlates with the Tenth House of Status [and] as a result, they're extremely sensitive about how they appear [in] context of everyone else. They want to appear better," MacGuire says.</p><p>They're also "represented by the climbing goat and the apex of the zodiac. Capricorn likes high places — anyplace where they can quite literally look down on everyone else." But due to the fact that many Capricorns <a href=#>have a tough go of it growing up</a>, they actually might be incredibly insecure, which in turn feeds into the narcissism. As MacGuire says, "It's their underlying insecurity that results in [their] need to overcompensate. They can overcompensate by being pretentious, which to the narcissistic Capricorn, abates their insecurities and fears of humiliation."</p><p>Any narcissistic tendencies they may have can also be a way of dealing with their need to succeed. "They can ... get quite depressed <a href=#>when they fall short of their high standards</a>, which can increase their need for superiority," MacGuire says. "Due to their insecurity, they can also take advantage of others to get what they want, a hallmark of narcissism."</p><p>To remedy all of the above, Capricorn should<a href=#> work on accepting themselves as they are</a> right now — "a worthy being despite what they have or have not achieved." Once they can do that, they'll "have less of a need to look down on other people. Further, with more confidence, they'll be less likely to take advantage of others to get what they want — they'll know they have the wherewithal to achieve their objectives in a fair and square way."</p><p>For anyone with narcissistic traits, it often just takes self-awareness to adjust to a healthier way of life. Narcissism is often fueled by <a href=#>underlying insecurities and pain from the past</a>, which is why addressing those issues is always a great place to start.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jq2fnquVYoBuxs6doJqbXai2qLrSZpirnV2ivLOxjKWgpJ2crnq1u4ybnGamkaewqr%2FSoqqtq11tgXWBj3Ju</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html&text=These%203%20Zodiac%20Signs%20Are%20More%20Likely%20To%20Be%20Narcissists&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html&title=These%203%20Zodiac%20Signs%20Are%20More%20Likely%20To%20Be%20Narcissists" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html&title=These%203%20Zodiac%20Signs%20Are%20More%20Likely%20To%20Be%20Narcissists" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html&title=These%203%20Zodiac%20Signs%20Are%20More%20Likely%20To%20Be%20Narcissists" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-3-zodiac-signs-are-more-likely-to-be-narcissists-8445097.html&description=These%203%20Zodiac%20Signs%20Are%20More%20Likely%20To%20Be%20Narcissists" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luna-blaise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Things To Know About Luna Blaise-The Fresh Off The Boat Actress">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./most-judgemental-zodiac-signs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Most Judgmental Zodiac Signs, According To Astrologers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
