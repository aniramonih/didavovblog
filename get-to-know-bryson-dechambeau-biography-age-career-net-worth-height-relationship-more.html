He has won eight PGA Tour titles, including a major championship and a U.S. Open title in 2020.</p><p>As an amateur, Bryson DeChambeau became the fifth player in history to win both the NCAA Division I Championship and the US Open in the same year.

His clubs are custom designed to his specifications, with thicker-than-usual grips and irons that are all the same length. In 2020, he became the longest-running driver on the PGA Tour.</p><p>Bryson DeChambeau was born in Modesto, California to John Howard Aldrich DeChambeau and Janet Louise Druffel. At the age of seven, he moved to Clovis, east of Fresno. He attended Clovis East High School and in 2010, at the age of 16, he won the California State Junior Championship.

In 2017, he gifted U.S. President Donald Trump golf clubs valued at $750.</p><p>On June 3, 2018, Bryson DeChambeau won the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, in a sudden-death playoff against Kyle Stanley and An Byeong-hun, after the three finished regulation play tied at −15. On November 4, 2018, Bryson DeChambeau won the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas, Nevada.
