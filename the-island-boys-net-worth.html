The Island Boys consists of fraternal twin brothers Franky and Alex Venegas. They are also known as Flyysoulja and Kodiyakredd.</p><p>In late 2021, the pair went viral with their song "I'm an Island Boy," which started as a video on Twitter before becoming a meme on TikTok.

They are of Cuban descent. The boys' father passed away when they were young, and they were subsequently raised by their single mother. Growing up, Franky and Alex were involved in numerous criminal activities that got them into trouble with the law, including robbery, grand theft auto, and drug possession. Due to this delinquent behavior, the brothers were kicked out of the house by their mother when they were 18. While in jail for one of their crimes, they decided to become rappers.</p><p>Franky and Alex first gained recognition in late 2021 when a video of them performing a song went viral on Twitter. The song was called "I'm an Island Boy." In the video, the brothers showed off their distinctive appearances, including their tattoos, vertical dreadlocks, and diamond teeth. The video went on to amass nine million views and become a meme on TikTok, where the Island Boys post under the page display name Flyysoulja. A fully produced version of "I'm an Island Boy," accompanied by a music video, was eventually released. The Island Boys promoted the release with a poorly received performance at Miami's Club LIV.</p><p>The Island Boys released their first EPs, "Stardom" and "Life Been Good," in 2021; both were credited to Flyysoulja. In 2022, the duo released the studio albums "17" and "Trendsetters," with the latter being credited to Kodiyakredd. The Island Boys continue to have a presence on TikTok, with more than seven million followers and over 150 million "likes."</p><p>Due to their viral success, the Island Boys have made some appearances in other media beyond the Internet. In 2022, it was announced that they would compete on the reality television show "Ultimate Social Boxing." The same year, the twins were the subjects of the documentary "Trolled: The Untold Island Boys Story," which documents their personal and professional lives.</p><h2 id=feuds><strong>Feuds</strong></h2><p>The Island Boys have been known to get into feuds with other social media personalities.

The video was reposted on TikTok by Texas-based army recruiter Orlando Tamez, whom the brothers named in their speech. After the video was again reposted, this time on Reddit, it attracted the attention of the US Army Recruiting Command, which issued a statement clarifying that the Island Boys were not authorized or paid to market the US Army.</p><h2 id=connection-andrew-james-thomas><strong>Connection to Andrew James Thomas</strong></h2><p>In early 2022, the Venegas brothers' Florida home was raided by police, who were looking for Andrew James Thomas. A childhood friend of the brothers, Thomas was arrested on the property in relation to a drive-by shooting that resulted in the death of an eight-year-old girl just three days earlier. Alex Venegas asserted that Thomas asked him to hide the gun in their house, and refused. Ultimately, the Venegas brothers were not implicated in the case; Thomas, meanwhile, was charged with multiple counts, including first-degree murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6m1pnnIrKOappRir7DF0malnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html&text=The%20Island%20Boys%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html&title=The%20Island%20Boys%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html&title=The%20Island%20Boys%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html&title=The%20Island%20Boys%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-island-boys-net-worth.html&description=The%20Island%20Boys%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1426988-tim-weatherspoons-biography-kelly-rowlands-husband-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Weatherspoons biography: who is Kelly Rowland's husband?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-700-million-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Hidden Creator Of Bitcoin Still Has A $700 Million Fortune Stashed Away">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
