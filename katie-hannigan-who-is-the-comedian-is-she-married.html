Her journey to comedy started from feeling like the weird one in gatherings. Subsequently, she began to embrace who she was and used it as a tool to make people laugh and happy.</p><p>She admitted that her parents even encouraged her to start a podcast when she was younger. The podcast covers memories of her hometown and her journey to her comedy debut.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Monte Lapka?
