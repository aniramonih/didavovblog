After three years he attended the school, he could smell the stench of raw sewage that came out of the slums from just feet away, and those were the “untouchables” whose struggles were then mentioned by any of the teachers or classmates and this had a lasting impression on Mohnish.</p><p>He later came to the United States in 1983 to study Computer Engineering at the South Clemson University, and he graduated the summa cum laude. After his graduation, he worked in the research and development of the Tellabs, and he worked there before launching his own IT consulting firm, which was named TransTech Inch and was released in 1991.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>There isn’t much known about his life, but it is known that he is married to Harina Kapoor, and his daughter’s name is Monsoon Pabrai.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on June 12 1964, Mohnish Pabrai is 60 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.

Later he sold his company to Kurt Salmon Associates for the US$20 million. Currently, he is also the managing partner of the Pabrai Investment Funds, founded in 1999.</p><p>Later in 2019, Pabrai expanded his US holdings and did this by tripling his holdings of the Micron Technology. He then invested in the 4.12 million shares of the Ohio-based GrafTech International Ltd., and it is a graphites electrodes and a petroleum coke manufacturer.</p><p>He is a big fan of Warren Buffett, and he also admits that his investment style is based on Buffett’s style, and he has also written a book on his investing style named “The Dhandho Investor: The Low – Risk Value Method to High Returns.” He was in headlines in June 2007 as he made headlines by bidding US$650,100 for a charity lunch with the infamous Warren Buffett. He made this bid with Guy Spier.</p><p>He has also written another book which is named Mosaic: Perspectives on Investing. In this book, he has narrowed down the methodology of Warren Buffett of investing to some significant points, and these points are made in a series of articles.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Mohnish won the 1999 KPMG Illinois High Tech Entrepreneur Award, which was given by KPMG, the city of Chicago, and the State of Illinois. He is also the member of Young President’s Organisation and the charter member of The Indus Entrepreneurs, which is also known as TIE.</p><p>He also started with the Dakshana Foundation with his wife in 2005, and the goal of this foundation was to recycle most of their wealth back to society.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Mohnish Pabrai in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mohnish-Pabrai-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, the net worth of Mohnish is estimated to be around $120 million, and it was reported that his net worth increased at an annual rate of 16% from the year 1995 to 2015.
