Most of the articles that surfaced about them were juicy gossip pieces that relied on unknown or unspecified sources.</p><p>However, the couple launched their iHeartRadio podcast in December 2023, about a year after being told to stop coming to work at GMA3. The platform has allowed them to share their story and thoughts on various matters, including whether they’d ever be interested in returning to their former employer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tj-holmes-replies-amy-robach-questions-podcast.jpg><p>During this past Thursday’s episode of Amy & T.J., Holmes indicated if he were asked to return, there would be a lot of questions associated with it.</p><p>“There’s a lot of ifs in there, and does that include working with you? Does that include working with some of the same folks that are still there? That would involve a lot…,” Holmes told Robach.</p><p>However, his bottom line was that he couldn’t see how he could return.</p><p>“Obviously, nobody over there is thinking about us coming back, but I couldn’t set up a scenario that actually makes sense,” Holmes said on <a href=#>the podcast episode</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robach-said-she-d-possibly-return-with-holmes>Robach said she’d possibly return with Holmes</h2><p>The couple recently put one another in the hot seat regarding a return to their former jobs, as Holmes had also asked Robach about it.</p><p>She initially wanted to know if that would include them asking both of them to return. When Holmes said “No,” Robach also seemed to say “No” to her return.</p><p>However, she said if Holmes were part of the return, she would need 24 hours to think it over and discuss it with him. The couple previously co-hosted ABC’s program GMA3, a “third hour” of Good Morning America that arrived in the afternoon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>After first being taken off the air amid the drama surrounding their relationship in December 2022, ABC launched an investigation. In January 2023, an <a href=#>ABC spokesperson </a>stated that Holmes and Robach had been terminated.</p><p>After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News. We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions,” ABC’s spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>GMA3 initially launched in 2018 with <a href=#>Michael Strahan</a> and Sara Haines as hosts. Keke Palmer joined them as a third host a year later.</p><p>Per <a href=#>Variety</a>, ABC took the show off the air in March 2020 with Robach, who was co-anchor of 20/20, hosting a show about hard news and medical advice.</p><p>In September 2020, it was announced Holmes would join Robach as a GMA3 host, and the show remained intact until their termination by the network.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-holmes-and-robach-enjoying-podcasting-despite-surprising-earnings>Are Holmes and Robach enjoying podcasting despite surprising earnings?</h2><p>After losing their jobs, they continued dating and also finalized their divorces. Robach finalized her divorce from actor Andrew Shue in March 2023, while Holmes reached a divorce settlement with attorney Marilee Fiebig in October 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Based on social media shares like the one above, the couple continues to enjoy one another’s company as they grow their relationship. However, it’s unclear how much they enjoy their current income situation.</p><p>In November 2023, <a href=#>The US Sun</a> reported they received a low sign-on advance of $50,000 each for their iHeartRadio podcast. In addition, they were expected to receive a 50/50 ad revenue split with iHeartRadio. The specifics of their deal were unknown, but some believed it was lower than other stars have received.</p><p>The Sun’s report shared that other celebrities and personalities received big podcast deals, such as Joe Rogan’s $30 million deal and Dax Shepherd’s $9 million deal with Spotify. However, an insider referred to Holmes and Robach’s podcast as a “vanity project.”</p><p>Lucrative or not, it appears that Holmes and Robach enjoy having a platform to express their views, possibly while contemplating other career ventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWismmK1sLjMnqpmqpWrsqK40magn2WYmrFuvsStrKumXam8brPMmmSanqSav264zqygp59dn7yjedaiq6FlkaLGbr7Om5icoF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html&text=TJ%20Holmes%20reveals%20if%20hed%20return%20to%20GMA%20after%20losing%20job%20with%20Amy%20Robach&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html&title=TJ%20Holmes%20reveals%20if%20hed%20return%20to%20GMA%20after%20losing%20job%20with%20Amy%20Robach" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html&title=TJ%20Holmes%20reveals%20if%20hed%20return%20to%20GMA%20after%20losing%20job%20with%20Amy%20Robach" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html&title=TJ%20Holmes%20reveals%20if%20hed%20return%20to%20GMA%20after%20losing%20job%20with%20Amy%20Robach" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftj-holmes-reveals-if-hed-return-to-gma-after-losing-job-with-amy-robach.html&description=TJ%20Holmes%20reveals%20if%20hed%20return%20to%20GMA%20after%20losing%20job%20with%20Amy%20Robach" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-scholz-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Scholz Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-trailer-just-dropped-for-ariana-grandes-highly-anticipated-netflix-doc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Trailer Just Dropped For Ariana Grande's Highly-Anticipated Netflix Doc">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
