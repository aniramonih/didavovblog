The music industry has grown from the simplest of roots to one of the biggest industries in the world today. Talented people who have a passion for music have taken advantage of God’s blessing to them to entertain the audiences around the world.</p><p>Millions and millions of people have invested in their talents to become the biggest names in the world. Music has been shifting from time to time, considering which era it is. There have been many different eras over the years, and in all eras, there have been some individuals who have taken the world by storm.</p><p>In 1999, one band was formed and took the United States of America by storm, and the band was called the Rascal Flatts. Rascal Flatts was an American country band in Columbus, Ohio. Just as mentioned in the introduction, the band focused on playing country music. The group of three musicians has had an amazing musical career by entertaining the country music fans.</p><p>They are very talented, and they blend in very well. They make good country music, which are still favorites for many fans. The band has been in existence for about twenty years, and they are still continuing to receive adoration from their fans. Despite all of this, the band did leave us with some bad news on the 7th of January in 2020. They stated that the band could disband following their farewell tour after twenty-one years in the business.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rascal Flatts</a> was formed in 1999 and is comprised of three members. The members are Gary LeVox (lead vocalist), his second cousin Jay DeMarcus (bass guitar), and Joe Don Rooney (guitar and banjo). Jay DeMarcus was also the brother-in-law of country music singer James Otto and formerly one-half of the Christian music duo, East to West. The group debuted in early 2000 with their hit single, “Prayin’ for Daylight.”</p><p>The song reached number three on the Billboard Country charts and was issued on Lyric Street, and after their first single hit, the album’s other three singles made the top ten on the chart. The band then released its second album in 2002, which they co-produced. In this album, it’s first single, “These Days,” became the band’s first number one hit on the U.S. country charts. Apart from that single, the others also did very well on the charts.</p><p>The band then released their third album in 2004 called, “Feels Like Today” and its album title track was released as the first single. The album became another success that just continued to prove how good the band actually was. The band released their fourth album in 2006 called, “Me and My Gang.”</p><p>The album’s first single release was their own version of ”What Hurts The Most,” which was originally recorded by Mark Wills in 2003. The band still continued to release hit singles under the album such as “My Wish” and “Stand,” which were the third and fourth releases in the album, which both reached number one on the charts.</p><p>“Me and My Gang” was the highest US debut in 2006, with 722,000 units in April. It was also the second best-selling album after High School Musical. In 2008, the band released their first compilation album, “Greatest Hits Volume 1” which comprised of thirteen of their biggest singles.</p><p>In October 2009, they released a second compilation of their greatest hits. At this moment, the band had received a lot of adoration and respect from listeners in the United States of America. They began performing live shows on big platforms such as the CMT Music Awards, Oprah’s Kickoff Party, and the finale of America’s Got Talent.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>The band had had an incredible run into their music career, but in April of 2010, Lyric Street was closed. But this did not leave the band stranded, in July of that year, they signed to Big Machine Records. This should’ve been obvious considering that the band had been extremely successful, and many record labels would not want to miss an opportunity to work with them. &nbsp;Under the new record label, the band was still releasing hit singles that were on the billboard charts. Certainly, even after losing their first record label, their light still shone brightly.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Rascal Flatts has been one of the best country music groups of all time. The band has released singles that have always been topping the Billboard charts. The band is undeniable one of a kind. Because of their awesomeness, the band as been honored in so many ways, one big way is showering them with awards that they deserve such as:</p><ul><li>People’s Choice Award for favorite Group in 2008 and 2009.</li><li>Academy of Country Music Award for Song of the Year in 2003.</li><li>Academy of Country Music Award for Vocal Group of the Year in 2007, 2008 and 2009.</li><li>Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year in 2006, 2007 and 2008.</li></ul><h2>Net Worth of Rascal Flatts in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rascal-Flatts-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The band’s successful career has really bore fruits for the band. Their music made them one of the most popular music groups in this generation. They have had a successful run with very few problems along the way. As of July 2024, the band has a net worth of about $200 million, which is an incredible figure for a country music group.</p><p>Rascal Flatts is one of the most popular music groups of this generation and has been very successful during the twenty-one years they have had as a group. The group is really talented, and they are appreciated for the things they’ve done. Although the band has stated plans of disbanding in 2024, many still hope that they stick around a little bit longer to entertain the fans a little bit more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZL%2Biv8Kao2aenJbBtb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jGtna2hdZ31zfY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html&text=Rascal%20Flatts%20Net%20Worth%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Rascal%20Flatts%20Net%20Worth%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Rascal%20Flatts%20Net%20Worth%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Rascal%20Flatts%20Net%20Worth%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frascal-flatts-net-worth-2020-2021.html&description=Rascal%20Flatts%20Net%20Worth%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./romelu-lukaku-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-156841-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Romelu Lukaku Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./179251-photos-stacy-keibler-carmen-electra-at-a-hollywood-event.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PHOTOS: Stacy Keibler &amp;amp; Carmen Electra at a Hollywood Event">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
