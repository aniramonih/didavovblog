However, some reports say the notorious drug lord of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, nicknamed El Chapo, has fathered up to 23 children. Some of Guzmán’s children took after him in the drug business, while others can be seen on social media flaunting the family’s wealth and living luxurious lifestyles. Meet them all here.</strong></p><h2><strong>Meet All of Joaquín Guzmán’s 15 Known Children</strong></h2><p>Though he claimed to have fathered up to 23 different children obviously from different women, Joaquín Guzmán’s children, who are officially known numbers about 15.</p><h3><strong>1.

He was born in the late 70s, shortly after his parent’s marriage. However, César didn’t follow in his father’s footsteps. He chose a different path as he went into business. He and his sister, Alejandrina Gisselle, are linked to the pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>They are also in charge of medical services, school, and office supplies.&nbsp;Their company, Gissell Arte Escolaresy de Oficina SA, was founded by members of his mother’s family in 2000. Over time, César and his sister Alejandrina Gisselle became partners of the company.</p><h4><strong>César Guzmán Salazar Has Diversified Into Other Businesses</strong></h4><p>As of 2009, César began venturing into other businesses; he entered the real estate sector with JDOBLECG Construcciones, S. A de CV, where he has 80% of the company’s shares. In July 2019, César ventured into the fashion industry by launching a clothing line, El Chapo 701, in his dad’s honor following his incarceration in 2016.</p><p>Apart from T-shirts, jeans, shirts, shoes, belts, hats, the brand has since grown to offer other products like accessories, jewelry, and liquors.&nbsp;While nothing much is known about his personal life, some <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>sources claim</a> that Cesar Guzmán Salazar was murdered in 2012.</p><h3><strong>2.

He was born on October 2, 1980, and is 43 years old as of this year. He is the leader of Los Chapitos and is looked on as the one that will succeed his father as the head of the cartel.</p><p>He lives a lavish lifestyle, and his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram account</a> is filled with photos of stacks of US dollars, Gucci wallets, expensive Swiss watches, pet tigers, and a gold-plated AK-47 propped against the dashboard of a Ferrari.</p><h4><strong>Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Is Living Up to His Father’s Legacy</strong></h4><p>In 2005, Iván was sentenced to five years behind bars for money laundering. However, he did not complete his jail term as he was released in August 2008 over lack of evidence. Iván and his brother Jesús Alfredo are part of the crew running the Sinaloa cartel, even as their dad still calls the shots from prison.</p><p>During the pandemic, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and his brother Ovidio Guzmán López ‘helped’ enforce a curfew in place in the city of Culiacán, northwestern Mexico. Defaulters were tortured and fined as the brothers, and their crew saw fit. Only essential service workers were treated with leniency.</p><h3><strong>3. Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: February 3, 1983</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Alfredillo and Jags</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 40 years old</li><li><strong>Parents</strong>: Joaquín Guzmán and Alejandrina María Salazar Hernández</li><li><strong>Biological siblings</strong>: César Guzmán Salazar, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, and Alejandrina Giselle Guzmán Salazar</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/pjimage.jpg><p>Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar was born on February 3, 1983, in Zapopan, Mexico. His mother was El Chapo’s first wife Alejandrina María Salazar Hernández and as of this year, he is 40 years old. Alfredo has been in charge of the cartel’s real estate holdings in Mexico and oversees most of the cartel’s shipments of drugs to the US.</p><p>In 2009, he was indicted for drug trafficking in Illinois, and a huge reward was offered for information that might lead to his arrest. In 2016, gunmen associated with the Jalisco cartel <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">kidnapped</a> Alfredo and five Sinaloa cartel associates at a tiny beach resort restaurant in Puerto Vallarta.</p><p>He was held for about a week but was released after Guzmán had threatened to go after the families of the leaders of the Jalisco Nueva Generación. Since the kidnapping, Alfredo and his brother Iván increasingly like to travel by private plane and in armored cars. Alfredo is the only one of Joaquín Guzmán’s children on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Drug Enforcement Administration’s 10 most wanted list</a>.</p><h3><strong>4.

She was born in 1986 and is 37 years old. Alejandrina is a college graduate and has been a surgeon since 2005.</p><p>Unlike some of her brothers from the same mother, Alejandrina Gisselle Guzmán Salazar is not directly linked with her father’s drug business. Instead, she is pursuing her career in medicine, even as she is also a fashion designer and businesswoman.</p><h4><strong>She Tried To Enter the USA Illegally in 2012</strong></h4><p>In October 2012, a seven-months-pregnant <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Alejandrina attempted</a> to enter the United States with falsified documents but was apprehended at the San Ysidro border, south of San Diego. She was impersonating a Mexican woman named Paola Ortega and had hoped to enter the US to give birth to her daughter and meet her child’s father in Los Angeles.</p><p>She was deported to Mexico after pleading guilty to the fraudulent use of a visa. As at the time of her arrest, Alejandrina Gisselle Guzmán Salazar was married to Dr. Juan Carlos Magana Jimenez, a medical practitioner from Guadalajara in Jalisco, Mexico.</p><h4><strong>Alejandrina Gisselle got into a Second Marriage in 2020</strong></h4><p>On January 25, 2020, she got into a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>second marriage with a relative of another crime kingpin – Édgar Cázares</a>, the nephew of Blanca Margarita Cázares Salazar. Her lavish closed-door wedding ceremony was held at the Sinaloa cathedral and the reception at a Culiacán venue called Álamo Grande. At the wedding, Alejandrina danced with her mother, María, in place of her father, who is still incarcerated in a US prison.</p><p>Her brother, Ovidio Guzman, was also in attendance.&nbsp;Alejandrina Gisselle is a staunch defender of her father and has a business with her brother honoring him. El Chapo 701 was launched in 2019 and featured El Chapo’s face on various T-shirts and tops.</p><p>She has also done philanthropic works under her father’s name, like distributing gifts in the impoverished areas of Guadalajara during the pandemic. She hopes to get rid of the social stigma attached to the name of El Chapo.</p><h3><strong>5.

It is reported that Edgar was the one chosen by El Chapo to replace him when he finished school. Edgar was already involved in his father’s business, tending a cocaine paste farm that supplied their cartel.</p><p>Unfortunately, on May 8, 2008, his life was cut short at the age of 22 by a group of 40 assassins that opened fire on him and his friends in a supermarket’s parking lot in Culiacan, Mexico. Edgar and his group were waiting for a girlfriend of theirs who was shopping at the supermarket when he was gunned down along with a cousin, Cesar Ariel Loera Guzman.</p><p>It was later revealed that his assailants were the Beltran Leyva Cartel members. After the shooting, police found over 500 bullet casings from AK-47 rifles in the parking lot.</p><h3><strong>6. Ovidio Guzmán López</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: March 29, 1990</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 33 years old</li><li><strong>Parents</strong>:&nbsp;Joaquín Guzmán and Griselda López Pérez</li><li><strong>Biological siblings</strong>: Édgar Guzmán López, Joaquín Guzmán López and Griselda Guadalupe</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/5S3M5HUFJJDDXIAPORNIMFPFOU-1280x720-1.jpg><p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, also known as El Raton (The Mouse) and Raton Nuevo (The New Mouse), was born on March 29, 1990, to El Chapo and his third wife, Griselda López Pérez. Currently 33 years old, Ovidio is suspected to be heavily involved in The Sinaloa cartel’s financing system.</p><p>Information on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>ICE website</a> stated that Ovidio Guzmán-López had ordered the murders of informants, a drug trafficker, and a popular Mexican singer who had refused to sing at his wedding.</p><p>On October 17, 2019, Ovidio Guzmán was arrested on conspiracy charges to import and distribute illegal drugs by members of the Mexican National Guard. The arrest was in line with a U.S. warrant issued by a federal judge in Washington, DC. However, things turned sour when authorities had to engage in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>tough gunfight</a> with members of his cartel.</p><p>Hundreds (over 700) of his cartel’s gunmen came to Ovidio’s aid, threatening and unleashing violence in the city, and by the end of the day, at least 13 people had lost their lives. Then Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had no choice but to set Ovidio free to “prevent more bloodshed.”</p><p></p><h4><strong>Why was El Chapo’s Son Released?</strong></h4><p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez was releaseed on the orders of President Lopez Obrador to avoid bloodshed when the Sinaloa Cartel waged an all out war in respnce to his arrest. The cartel had blocked off roads, set vehicles on fire, and attacked government buildings while also threatening to kill civilians, including children.</p><p>About four years later in 2023, Ovidio Guzman was arrested again and is waiing to be extradited to the United States.</p><h3><strong>7. Joaquin Guzmán López</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Birth Year</strong>: 1986</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 37 years old</li><li><strong>Parents</strong>: Joaquín Guzmán and Griselda López Pérez</li><li><strong>Biological siblings</strong>: Édgar Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López and Griselda Guadalupe</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/pjimage-1.jpg><p>Joaquin Guzmán López, who also goes by the name El Güero Moreno, is another son of El Chapo and his third wife Griselda López Pérez. Joaquin has been responsible for sourcing and distributing cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine from Mexico to the United States since 2008.</p><p>Unlike his brothers, Joaquin Jr. lives a discrete lifestyle; as such, very little is known about him. On Twitter, his profile reads: “I am not into luxury and sports cars, I like horses and fine roosters.”</p><h3><strong>8. Griselda Guadalupe Guzmán López</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Parents</strong>: Joaquín Guzmán and Griselda López Pérez</li><li><strong>Biological siblings</strong>: Édgar Guzmán López, Joaquín Guzmán López and Ovidio Guzmán López</li></ul><p>Griselda Guadalupe Guzmán López is the daughter Joaquín Guzmán with third wife, Griselda López Pérez. Information on Griselda Guadalupe Guzmán López is not available for now.&nbsp;Officially, it has been confirmed that she is indeed El Chapo’s daughter.</p><p>However, she has chosen to lie low due to one reason or the other. Perhaps coming out publicly to announce that one share some DNA with the notorious drug lord might put one in danger, thus the reason to avoid publicity.</p><h3><strong>9&10. Emali Guadalupe and </strong><strong>Maria Joaquina (Twin)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: August 15, 2011</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 12 years old</li><li><strong>Parents</strong>: Joaquín Guzmán and Emma Coronel Aispuro</li></ul><p>Emali Guadalupe and Maria Joaquina are the twin daughters of El Chapo with his fourth wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro. They were born on August 15, 2011, at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California, and they hold American citizenship. Interestingly, their father’s name was left off their birth certificate as he was a wanted fugitive.&nbsp;However, the twins visited their father alongside their mom while his trial was ongoing.</p><p>Obviously, Emma Coronel Aispuro lives a very lavish lifestyle, as can be seen by her posts on social media, who loves to spoil the girls.&nbsp;For example, in 2018, she hosted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>extravagant 7th birthday party</a> for the twins that featured a life-sized pink Barbie mansion and a long table covered with flowers, desserts, and a towering birthday cake.</p><p>Emali and her sister Maria were only two years old when their father was arrested while making breakfast for his family in their apartment. The twins, who would be 12 years old this year, reside in El Chapo’s home state of Sinaloa alongside Coronel’s family members.</p><h3><strong>11. Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: November 25, 1973</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 50 years old</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/rosa-isela-guzman-chapo-guzman-hija-2.jpg><p>Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz is the eldest daughter of El Chapo by one of his mistresses in Jalisco. She was born in 1973 and lives in California. Although she was born in Mexico, the now 50 years old Guzmán holds U.S. citizenship. In 2015, Guzman Ortiz admitted that she is still in touch with some cartel members she calls “narco juniors,” i.e., second-generation cartel members.</p><p>She also opened and ran several businesses in the United States with funds obtained from her father, including hair salons, soda machines, car washes, etc.&nbsp;An investigation into this business, their funding, and the motives for them as an avenue for money laundering landed her in jail for 15 days.</p><p>According to her, the said businesses are no longer in her name.&nbsp;Also, her former husband was arrested in 2009 and extradited to the U.S, where he entered a plea agreement in 2014 and was sentenced to 10 years after admitting to working for El Chapo.&nbsp;Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz is currently in remission after a tough battle with cancer.</p><p>She is an avid supporter of her father, opining that her father isn’t a criminal, but rather the government is guilty.&nbsp;She is a mother of four, two of her kids were with Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada.</p><h3><strong>12. Kim Guzmán Dolci</strong></h3><p>Like Griselda Guadalupe Guzmán López, information on El Chapo’s daughter, Kim Guzmán Dolci, is currently unavailable. Kim is one of Joaquín Guzmán’s children by a mistress. She has maintained a low profile and is only on the official records as one of El Chapo’s daughters.</p><h3><strong>13. Laisha Guzmán</strong></h3><p>Laisha Guzmán, just like some of El Chapo’s children, chose to stay out of the limelight. Information on her is nonexistent. She, however, appears on the official list of El Chapo’s children. Whatever may be her reasons for keeping a low profile, perhaps not everyone would like to be linked with El Chapo and the Sinaloa Cartel.</p><h3><strong>14. Victor Alael Hernández López</strong></h3><p>Victor Alael Hernandez López is another enigmatic child of El Chapo. Apart from his name being on the official records as one of El Chapo’s sons by a mistress, there is no other information on him. Perhaps keeping a low profile keeps him out of harm’s way. Besides, several of El Chapo’s children had been kidnapped in time past.</p><h3><strong>15. Rubencito is </strong><strong>Joaquin Guzmán’s Youngest Child</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Birth Year</strong>: 2014 or 2015</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 9 or 8 years old</li><li><strong>Parents</strong>: Joaquín Guzmán and Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López</li></ul><p>Rubencito is El Chapo’s last known child by mistress Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López. The date of his birth isn’t clear. Since his mother <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>testified against El Chapo</a> in court during his trial, it is safe to assume that we wouldn’t be getting any more info on him. Even his name might be an alias, and who knows, he might be in witness protection along with his mom.</p><p>Sánchez claimed that she and El Chapo started dating in 2011 when his wife Emma Coronel Aispuro was still pregnant with their twin daughter. It is believed that Sánchez had a son with Joaquin Guzmán, who is now named Rubencito. When Ms. Sánchez visited El Chapo in prison in September 2014, she appeared to be in the latter stages of her pregnancy. Meaning that Rubencito was born either in late 2014 or early 2015, therefore pegging his age at 9 or 8 years old.</p><h2><strong>How Involved Are Joaquin Guzmán’s Children in His Businesses?</strong></h2><p>Out of the 15 children of Joaquín Guzmán, only four of them are actively involved in the running of their father’s cartel. They are Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, Ovidio Guzmán López (El Raton), Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar, and Joaquín Guzmán López. A fifth child, Edgar Ivan Guzman Lopez (El Nino de Oro), was involved in cartel business but was killed in 2008 in a shootout with Mexican authorities.</p><h2><strong>Where are El Chapo’s Kids Now?</strong></h2><p>Most of El Chapo’s kids who are not involved in the drug business live quiet lives. Some have been said to be flamboyant with the wealth they have, but much about them is unknown. Those who are known include Ovidio Guzmán López, who is incarcerated at the Altiplano Federal Prison in Mexico after being arrested in January 2023 on drug trafficking charges. He is waiting to be extradited to the United States.</p><p>The whereabouts of Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar are unknown, but they are believed to be hiding out in Mexico, where they continue to run the Sinaloa cartel. The duo are on the run and have a $5 million bounty on their head.</p><p>Joaquín Guzmán López is also believed to be living in Mexico, but his whereabouts are not known.</p><h3><strong>Who is El Chapo’s Oldest Son?</strong></h3><p>César Guzmán Salazar is El Chapo’s first child and son by his first wife, Alejandrina María Salazar Hernández. He was born in the late 70s, shortly after his parent’s marriage. Cesar is not involved in his father’s business, so nothing is known about him.
