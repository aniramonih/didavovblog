He lives now. He is real. He knows you. He is your Savior as He is my Savior, and you are His disciples as I am His disciple.”</p><p>And emphasizing the merits of repentance and forgiveness, the Apostle read <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Doctrine and Covenants 58:42</a> and added: “You have the power to say, ‘I know I have been forgiven because I repented and God remembers my sins no more.’ This is the message of hope, the message of joy. It is one of the most hopeful verses in the holy scriptures.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6bc5cfc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1905+0+0/resize/730x464!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F-V3V4CLWjJjbs6XOqeRnV5-iIRU%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x1905%2F3000x1905%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281500x953%3A1501x954%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24603379%2Fmerlin_2975313.jpg"><p>Sister Uchtdorf spoke of visiting the area near the Sea of Galilee where Christ would have taught the Beatitudes (see <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Matthew 5:3–12</a>; <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Luke 6:20–23</a>) during His Sermon on the Mount. “The Beatitudes can shape your attitude,” she said before reading them.</p><p>“Do you see how these words of Christ can influence you for good?” she asked before linking attitude with gratitude and then closing with her testimony of the Savior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fca1d88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1831+0+0/resize/730x446!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FYPZjRy5zSBJW-jMXBI-n3q2_HpI%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x1831%2F3000x1831%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281500x916%3A1501x917%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24603397%2Fmerlin_2975309.jpg"><h2>What BYU Jerusalem Center students were saying</h2><p>Devin Duffy, a BYU Jerusalem Center student from Denver, Colorado, said he loved the Uchtdorfs’ point of cultivating an attitude of gratitude. “I’ve felt the presence of the Lord so much here in the Holy Land, and I want to maintain that when I go back. So it dawned on me that I can create a templelike space in my heart, wherever I’m at. I can create a sphere of positivity, uplift, joy, forgiveness and kindness wherever I am —&nbsp;and that will ensure that wherever I am, I will have the Savior with me.”</p><p>Said Sadie Eyre of Chicago, Illinois: “What was solidified for me was the joy that the gospel brings — not only to us as individuals, but that we can be peacemakers and see others as Christ sees them, whether that’s here in the Holy Land or at home. The light of Christ is truly in others, and we can find that light.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/201d8ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2140+0+0/resize/730x521!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FzqkT1NZoZ6Db3mRdGczrqJOmjk4%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x2140%2F3000x2140%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281500x1070%3A1501x1071%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24603390%2Fmerlin_2975315.jpg"><p>Syrena Dyreng of Hillsborough, North Carolina, said the Spirit confirmed to her that God really does speak to His children and that He can in so many ways.</p><p>Cub Johnson of Boise, Idaho, said he appreciated Elder Uchtdorf’s message about the youth and young adults not only being the future of the Church but also its present and part of the body of Christ. “I might be the foot, but I’m still part of the body of Christ — that’s so beautiful that I can do my part to bring light to this earth right now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b9aac5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1908+0+0/resize/730x464!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FF4merjQAKFeTBCKUI74r4jcLFZ4%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x1908%2F3000x1908%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281500x954%3A1501x955%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24603388%2Fmerlin_2975329.jpg"><p>Ellie Mason of Mesa, Arizona, said she learned through the Spirit and Elder Uchtdorf’s instruction that she can help lead in the Church of Jesus Christ. “God is not just expecting me to foresee the future, and He doesn’t expect me to make perfect decisions for this perfect path that He already has created.
