Although he is best known for being a member of the rock band Jane's Addiction, he has been an integral part of many other groups in the past. His other most notable band was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and he contributed to one of their albums. His other bands have included Deconstruction and The Panic Channel. Outside of his work with both of these bands, Dave has released one solo album.</p><p>In addition to his musical career, Dave has experienced considerable success as an actor and a presenter. In terms of his television work, he is probably best known for his appearances on the show "Ink Master." Numerous observers have called Dave Navarro one of the greatest guitarists of the modern era, and he is known for blending a number of different genres in his guitar work. Dave has expressed support for a range of both Republican and Democratic political candidates, including <a href=# title="Mitt Romney Net Worth">Mitt Romney</a> and <a href=# title="Tulsi Gabbard Net Worth">Tulsi Gabbard</a>. He considers himself a Libertarian.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>David Michael Navarro was born on June 7th of 1967 in Santa Monica, California. At the age of seven, Navarro started playing guitar for the first time after becoming inspired by <a href=# title="Jimi Hendrix Net Worth">Jimi Hendrix</a>. Dave attended high school in Sherman Oaks, and during his early years he joined the marching band alongside Stephen Perkins.</p><p>When Navarro was still a teen, his mother was murdered by an ex-boyfriend. At this point, Dave's parents were living separately, and he was with his father at the time of the murder. Navarro later revealed that his mother's death contributed to his downward spiral into drug addiction and mental health issues.</p><h2 id=jane8217s-addiction><strong>Jane's Addiction</strong></h2><p>In 1986, Dave Navarro joined the band Jane's Addiction as the group's lead guitarist. Stephen Perkins, a childhood friend of Dave's, was already in the band as a drummer. Over the next few years, Jane's Addiction became a highly successful group within the alternative-rock world. During Dave's time with the band, he contributed to three of the band's albums. The first came in 1987, when Jane's Addiction released their self-titled live album. Critics praised the release, saying that it was a sign that the group had matured over the years.</p><p>Navarro then contributed to the group's first major-label studio album, "Nothing's Shocking." The 1988 album was released through Warner Bros. Records and received strong reviews from critics â€“ although it failed to break into the top 100 on the charts. It was at this point that internal tensions started to arise within the band. However, Jane's Addiction managed to stay together to release a second studio album in 1990.</p><p>Entitled "Ritual de lo habitual," this second studio album became a massive commercial hit. With hits like "Been Caught Stealing" and "Stop," the album soon earned double platinum status in the United States. In fact, just one month after being released, "Ritual de lo habitual" had sold 500,000 units.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-310217 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dn.jpg alt width=794 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-310217 class=wp-caption-text>Brad Barket/Getty Images</p><h2 id=red-hot-chili-peppers><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, this would prove to be the last album "Jane's Addiction" would release before they broke up in 1991.

In 1993, he found a more permanent home with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He performed live with the band and contributed to their album "One Hot Minute," which was released in 1995.
