The historical drama, which tells the story of the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb, features a controversial scene where Pugh’s character, Jean Tatlock, is seen topless and reciting verses from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita while having sex with Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy.</p><p>The scene has sparked outrage and criticism from some religious and government officials in India and the Middle East, who have deemed it as an attack on Hinduism and a violation of cultural norms. Some countries have even censored the scene by adding a CGI black dress to cover Pugh’s nudity, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter and The New York Post. In this article, we will explore the background and context of the scene, the reactions and responses from different perspectives, and the implications and consequences of censorship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Background_and_context></span>Background and context<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The scene in question is based on a historical fact: Oppenheimer and Tatlock did have an affair in the late 1930s, when they were both working at the University of California, Berkeley. Tatlock was a brilliant psychiatrist and a member of the Communist Party of America, while Oppenheimer was a renowned physicist and a leader of the Manhattan Project, the secret program that produced the first nuclear weapons during World War II.</p><p>According to biographer Kai Bird, who co-wrote American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Tatlock introduced Oppenheimer to the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu text that contains philosophical and ethical teachings. Oppenheimer was fascinated by the text and learned Sanskrit to read it in its original language. He later quoted a verse from the text after witnessing the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico in 1945: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Florence-Pugh-Oppenheimer-Scene-Reactions-and-responses.jpg><p>The Bhagavad Gita is part of the Mahabharata, an epic poem that narrates the Kurukshetra War, a conflict between two rival clans over the throne of Hastinapura. The text is presented as a dialogue between Arjuna, a warrior prince who is reluctant to fight his own relatives and Krishna, his charioteer and guide who reveals himself as an incarnation of Vishnu, the supreme god of Hinduism. Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duty as a warrior without attachment to the results of his actions, as this is the path of dharma (righteousness) and karma (action).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Florence_Pugh_Oppenheimer_Scene_Reactions_and_responses></span>Florence Pugh Oppenheimer Scene: Reactions and responses<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The scene depicting Pugh and Murphy reading from the Bhagavad Gita while having sex has been met with mixed reactions from critics and audiences. Some have praised it as a bold and artistic choice that reflects Oppenheimer’s inner conflict and fascination with the text, while others have criticized it as a gratuitous and disrespectful depiction of sacred scripture that has nothing to do with the plot or the characters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>One of the most vocal critics of the scene is Uday Mahurkar, an information commissioner for the Indian Government, who tweeted on July 22 that he had written to Nolan to demand an explanation for the scene. He called it “a scathing attack on Hinduism” and “a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus”. He also questioned the “motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene on life of a scientist” and said it “amounts to waging a war on<br>the sentiments of Hindus”.</p><p>Other Indian officials and religious leaders have echoed Mahurkar’s sentiments and called for a boycott or ban of the film in India. Some have also accused Nolan of being biased against Hinduism and promoting Christianity or Islam instead. For instance, Swami Chakrapani Maharaj, president of All India Hindu Mahasabha, said that Nolan should apologize to Hindus for hurting their sentiments and that he should make a film on Jesus Christ or Prophet Muhammad instead.</p><p>However, not all Indians share this view. Some have defended Nolan’s artistic freedom and argued that he did not intend to offend anyone or disrespect any religion. They have pointed out that Oppenheimer himself was influenced by the Bhagavad Gita and that he quoted it several times in his life. They have also noted that Nolan is known for his complex and nuanced films that explore themes such as morality, identity, time, memory, and reality.</p><p>Some have also suggested that the scene could be interpreted as a metaphor for Oppenheimer’s dilemma: whether to pursue his scientific curiosity or to consider the ethical implications of his work. They have compared the scene to the famous painting The Kiss by Gustav Klimt, which depicts a couple embracing and kissing while surrounded by gold and floral patterns. They have argued that the scene is not meant to be literal or realistic, but rather symbolic and artistic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Florence-Pugh-Oppenheimer.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Implications_and_consequences></span>Implications and consequences<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The controversy over the scene has raised several questions and issues regarding the role and responsibility of filmmakers, the rights and expectations of audiences, and the impact and influence of censorship. Some of the questions and issues are:</p><ul><li>How much creative license should filmmakers have when depicting historical figures and events? Should they stick to the facts or embellish them for dramatic effect? Should they respect the cultural and religious sensitivities of different countries and regions or challenge them for artistic expression?</li><li>How much information and context should audiences have when watching films based on history? Should they do their own research or rely on the filmmakers to provide accurate and balanced portrayals? Should they judge the films based on their own beliefs and values or try to understand the perspectives and intentions of the filmmakers?</li><li>How much censorship should be imposed on films that contain nudity, violence, profanity, or controversial content? Should censorship be decided by the filmmakers, the distributors, the governments, or the audiences? Should censorship be consistent across different countries and regions or vary according to local norms and laws?</li><li>How does censorship affect the quality and integrity of films? Does it enhance or diminish the artistic vision and message of the filmmakers? Does it protect or harm the rights and interests of the audiences? Does it promote or hinder the diversity and dialogue of cultures and religions?</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The scene in Oppenheimer featuring Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy reading from the Bhagavad Gita while having sex has sparked a heated debate among critics, audiences, officials, and religious leaders. The scene has been praised by some as a daring and artistic depiction of Oppenheimer’s inner turmoil and fascination with the text, and condemned by others as a disrespectful and offensive portrayal of a sacred scripture that has no relevance to the plot or the characters. The scene has also been censored in some countries by adding a CGI black dress to cover Pugh’s nudity, which has raised questions and issues about the role and responsibility of filmmakers, the rights and expectations of audiences, and the impact and influence of censorship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u5sL7Ep5qeZaCqtKl5zqmnnqaYmrausdFmqpydnpp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html&text=Florence%20Pugh%20Oppenheimer%20Scene%20Leaked%20Video%20Sparks%20Controversy%20Online&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html&title=Florence%20Pugh%20Oppenheimer%20Scene%20Leaked%20Video%20Sparks%20Controversy%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html&title=Florence%20Pugh%20Oppenheimer%20Scene%20Leaked%20Video%20Sparks%20Controversy%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html&title=Florence%20Pugh%20Oppenheimer%20Scene%20Leaked%20Video%20Sparks%20Controversy%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflorence-pugh-oppenheimer-scene.html&description=Florence%20Pugh%20Oppenheimer%20Scene%20Leaked%20Video%20Sparks%20Controversy%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./georgina-rodriguez-seen-at-cannes-film-festival-as-she-makes-first-public-appearance-since-the-death-of-her-newborn-son.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Georgina Rodriguezs Public Debut at Cannes Film Festival following the Loss of Her Newborn Son">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./exhaled-heavily-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exhaled heavily">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
