He came into prominence in 1980 when he appeared in the TV show “Second City Television”.&nbsp; since which Rick Moranis has been a star of such Hollywood movies as “Strange Brew”, “Little Shop of Horrors”, “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids”, and “Ghostbusters”. Moreover, Rick had a chance to increase the total size of his net worth while appearing in “Spaceballs”, “Little Giants”, “The Flintstones”, and “My Blue Heaven”. There are no doubts the incomes from these popular movies are the reasons why Rick Moranis’ wealth increased.</p><p>So just how rich is Rick Moranis? Sources estimate that Rick’s net worth is $10 million, which has been accumulated from careers in the music and film industries.</p><h3>Rick Moranis Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>However, in 1996 Rick decided to take a break from acting, and instead enlarge his net worth from voice acting. As a voice actor, Rick Moranis is known for such movies as “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys”, “Brother Bear”, and “Brother Bear 2”.</p><p>Rick then started pursuing a career hosting radio shows, as well as working as a DJ. On the radio Rick was known under the name Rick Allan. In total, he hosted on three radio stations that were based in Toronto. Rick`s show at Second City Television was received well, in particular his impersonations of such famous persons as David Brinkley, <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>, and George Carlin. Rick was praised for these portrayals, which added great sums to the total size of Rick Moranis’ net worth.</p><p>Later on, Rick decided he needed a partnership in show business. Thus, along with Dave Thomas he created a production under the name “The Great White North”. This duo was also received very well, thus further boosting Rick Moranis’ net worth. They became a very popular duo in pop culture, and this popularity was increased even more after the release of their album called Great White North which received a Grammy nomination. “Strange Brew” is considered to be Rick`s first big role; actually, Rick also wrote and directed this movie, released in 1983. “The Flinstones”, released in 1994, features the last big role of <a href=#>Rick Moranis</a>.</p><p>What is significant to know about Rick`s accomplishments is that for his portrayal in Parenthood (1989), Rick was rewarded with an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. Rick was also rewarded with a Primetime Emmy Award and Earle Grey Award. Rick Moranis`s TV credits include “Saturday Night Live”, “Hockey Night”, “The Rocket Boy”, “Gravedale High”, “The Earth Day Special”, and “Muppets Tonight”.</p><p>Furthermore, Rick, as a singer, has released the following: The Great White North, Strange Brew soundtrack, You, Me, the Music and Me, The Agoraphobic Cowboy, My Mother`s Brisket and Other Love Songs.</p><p>In his personal life, Rick Moranis was married to Anne Belsky from 1986 until her death in 1991 – they had two children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.544378698225><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rick Moranis</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 18, 1953 (age 62</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Toronto, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft (1.5494 m)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Comedian, Actor, Magician, Screenwriter, Voice Actor, Television producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canada</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Anne Moranis (m. 1986–1991)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nicknames</td><td>Richard Moranis , Frederick Alan Moranis , Frederick Allan Moranis , Rick Cougar Moranis , Moranis, Rick , Frederick Allan "Rick" Moranis , Rick Allan</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001548</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing - Variety Series, Earle Grey Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Albums</td><td>My Mother's Brisket & Other Love Songs</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Bob and Doug McKenzie</td></tr><tr readability=25><td>Movies</td><td>Ghostbusters, Spaceballs, Little Shop of Horrors, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Ghostbusters II, The Flintstones, Strange Brew, Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, Brother Bear, My Blue Heaven, Streets of Fire, Little Giants, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, Parenthood, Brother Bear 2, Big Bully, Club Paradise, Brewst...</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Bob & Doug, Gravedale High, Second City Television, SCTV Network 90</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Short stature</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Large glasses</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Nerdy characters</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=24.236559139785><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3.7512953367876><td>1</td><td>[on refusing a cameo in <a href=#>Ghostbusters</a> (2016)]: I wish them well, I hope it's terrific.

In the early movies I did, I was brought in to basically rewrite my stuff, whether it was <a href=#>Ghostbusters</a> (1984) or <a href=#>Spaceballs</a> (1987). By the time I got to the point where I was "starring" in movies, and I had executives telling me what lines to say, that wasn't for me. I'm really not an actor. I'm a guy who comes out of comedy, and my impetus was always to rewrite the line to make it funnier, not to try to make somebody's precious words work.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>3</td><td>I'm a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.</td></tr><tr readability=29><td>4</td><td>Until 1982, Canada Day was known as Dominion Day. I always thought that had more of a ring to it. Beyond the zippy alliteration, it reminded us citizens that our domain of orderly domesticity was graced by the dominant power of our "Dominus." And the rights granted therein to us by the glorious English crown through her colonial appointee, the right honourable governor general. 'There was another problem with Dominion Day. Dominion was the name of a national grocery store chain. It would be like calling the Fourth of July D'Agostino's Day. 'Independence (now there's a great name for a day!) came slowly to our country. In 1965, we dumped the old, staid British ensign for our own new flag. in lIt's the one with the big red maple leaf in the middle. A simple, sweet leaf! We also have moose and beavers on our coins. And we call our dollars loonies because the coin has an image of a loon. Another old bird, the Queen of England, is on the other side of the coin. 'I remember singing "God Save the Queen" every morning in school. "Long live our noble Queen!" we belted, thousands of us tubby little obedient Canadians. I guess it worked. She's still alive. Now they sing "O Canada" in schools and at most sporting events; usually in French and English. Around the time we were changing anthems, dumping ensigns and renaming holidays, the official use of both languages became mandatory, except in Quebec where the required use of English is a bit fuzzy. 'Canada Day comes and goes modestly every year. Sure, there are retail sales promotions and a long weekend. But there isn't bluster or commodity in Canadian celebration. Canada isn't big on bunting. Or jet flyovers, fireworks, marching bands or military pomp. 'Canadians defer. We save our loonies and don't jaywalk. It's illegal, eh. We stand on guard at red lights, even when there is no traffic. We wait for clear, green governing lights to signal our turn and lead us on. Then we tuck our heads down, under wooly toques and worn-out scarves, one eye barely open, squinting headlong into the harsh prairie wind, cautiously, quietly, demurely Canadian.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=42.712040490144><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>He is notoriously private about his children.
