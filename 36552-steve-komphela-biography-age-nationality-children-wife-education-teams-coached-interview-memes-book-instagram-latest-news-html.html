He is the youngest child of Nomalanga Komphela and Jack Koyi Koyo who had 10 other children. When he completed his primary and secondary education, Mbuyi studied to become a professional teacher and got a teacher's diploma from Free State's Tshiya College.</p><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f13b85c6a4f41827.jpg><p class=align-left>As a player, his career started out at Klerksdorp City in the NSL Second Division. He then joined Qwa Qwa Stars, and it was from here that he was promoted to the National Soccer League. In 1992, his team had an impressive season that saw them finish third and himself voted as the NSL Players' Player of the Year. He later played for other teams including the Kaizer Chiefs and Gaziantepspor in Turkey (1993) before hanging his boots in 1997.</p><p class=align-left>Internationally, he helped start the new national team for South Africa. He made his debut in 1992 when Mzansi beat Cameroon 1-0. Up until 1995, he played almost 50% of all the national games although he did not make the cut for the 1996 African Cup of Nations.</p><p class=align-left>His coaching career started in 2002 when he landed a role as the manager of Manning Rangers F.C. He managed several clubs between that time and 2015 where he stayed on each team for one season only. He joined the Kaizer Chiefs in 2015 and signed a 3-year contract.</p><h4><strong>Steve Komphela resigns</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Due to the inability of his team to win any trophy, In July 2018, Mr. Mbuyi was forced to resign from Kaizer Chiefs before the end of his contract. The pressure to step down was as a result of the violent protests that Kaizer fans launched in every match, as well as the negative comments that were trending online. He moved to Bloemfontein Celtics.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, when he joined Bloemfontein Celtics for the 2018-19 Premier Soccer League, Steve won his first six games in charge. He even managed to draw with the mighty Chiefs 2-2 in the first half and beat Orlando Pirates. However, he quit after six months with his interviews showing issues at the club level that extended even to Steve Komphela house, like DSTV being shut down. Currently, he is rebuilding his career with the Golden Arrows.</p><h3>Steve Komphela wife</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Steve Komphela wife? Mbuyi is presently married to Mamoepi Komphela, and together they have three kids: Nombuyiselo Komphela, Nomalanga Komphela, and Noxolo Komphela.</p><h3>Steve Komphela salary</h3><p class=align-left>He earns between R300,000 and R400,000.</p><h3>Steve Komphela cars</h3><p class=align-left>The sportsman is a lover of fast cars. Currently, he is a proud <a href=# title="steve komphela cars" rel="nofollow noopener">owner of</a> a Harley Davidson and a Lamborghini Gallardo. All this and he still bought a new car (2018 Mercedes-Benz SLC Class) late last year that is worth more than <a href=# title="steve komphela cars" rel="nofollow noopener">R178 million</a>.</p><h3>Steve Komphela quotes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4a41b3c67b470196.jpg><p class=align-left>Some of the famous Komphela quotes include:</p><li>It (refereeing standards) is purely rubbish and if you go through the rubbish then you will come out stinking. It is discouraging.</li><li>Already there are two ways in coaching: entrance and exit; hired and fired.</li><li>I sincerely apologize for coming late, we just came from Cape Town. On our way here, you know this is a democratic South Africa, and we had to go through the JMPD (Metro Police). Fortunately, I got out clean! Please, we have to pay our traffic fines.</li><li>An error is an error if committed once and an error becomes suspicious if committed twice and thrice. But the minute it becomes more consistent, then it is deliberate.</li><li>That’s a nice question. Most questions have answers in them if you listen attentively but it’s a very good question.</li><li>We are the biggest toilet in the world; whenever we want to relieve ourselves it is the easiest to get rid of the coach.</li><p class=align-left>With such quotes, it is not surprising that there are lots of Steve Komphela memes in circulation right now. Some fans even went ahead to predict that there will be a book on Steve's parables.</p><h3>The book</h3><p class=align-left>In line with the above prediction, last year, the renowned football manager hinted that he was busy writing a book. What is Steve Komphela book about?
