She has a brother named Gabriel, and the two were brought up in the Catholic faith. Both her parents were of Puerto Rican descent, and she has often referred her community as amalgamation. At the age of five, her family relocated to Yorktown Heights.</p><p>She attained her early education from Yorktown High School, from where she graduated in 2007. During her time in high school, she excelled in a microbiology project, and as a way of showing appreciation, a small asteroid was named after her by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The asteroid goes by the name of 23238 Ocasio-Cortez. She attended Boston University from where she graduated with a BA in international relations and economics as well.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In 2008, the father of Alexandria died after a long battle with lung cancer, and following the death, her mother and her grandmother faced a lot of financial hardships, and this prompted them to move to Florida. She has discussed the impact of her Catholic faith on her criminal justice reforms, and this is a result of being born and raised in the catholic faith.</p><p>After completing her studies, Ocasio worked as a bartender and waitress in the Bronx. This was in an attempt to help her mother, who was then working as a school bus driver and a house cleaner with the bills. So far, Alexandria is not married.

She challenged Joe Crowley, becoming his first challenger since 2004. Though she was at a financial disadvantage, she was determined to use a different game to capture the seat. She received endorsements from different civil rights organizations as well as individuals.</p><p>She gained national wide attention after overthrowing the incumbent by close to 15% points in the primaries. She went ahead and won the general election against Anthony Pappas. After this, she received very wide media coverage that included talk shows and articles.</p><p>Upon the return of the 116th Congress in January 2019, Ocasio had no seniority, but her social media presence was very large. She had millions and millions of followers on her social media accounts. She made her maiden speech on the floor in January 2019, and after the video was tweeted, it received a very big number of viewers. Ever since, the contributions she makes have been highly recommended.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>After finishing high school and excelling in a science and engineering fair, Alexandria was honored by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, by naming an asteroid after her.
