While some media reported he was already her boyfriend, neither clarified what their connection was.</li><li>In early 2018, Ekta was already contemplating whether she would have enough time and effort for a kid. She stated: “All of my friends who were married now aren’t. With the number of divorces I’ve seen recently, I think I’m more patient. I definitely know one thing, that I want a child but not marriage. I don’t have time for myself, and if I get a couple of hours, I would like to go to a spa.” Her dad really wanted her to get married at some point, and he even prayed for that to happen. His wish came true, at least partially, when Ekta followed in her younger brother’s footsteps, who got a kid through surrogacy in 2016 because he felt he was getting older and was not married. After she fell in love with being an aunt to her nephew Laksshya, on January 27, 2019, through surrogacy, her son Ravie Kapoor was born. An actress and TV presenter, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mona Singh</a>, her close friend, also took on the role of a babysitter for Ekta. When he made an appearance on August 26, 2019, many people stated that Ravie was the “spitting image of his mom.”</li><figure id=attachment_166586 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166586 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ekta Kapoor at Zee Rishtey Awards in December 2010 (Filmitadka / www.filmitadka.in / CC BY-SA 3.0)</figure><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>Asian (Indian)</p><p>She is of Indian descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Black</p><p>She has also dyed her hair ‘Dark Brown’ in the past.</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Dark Brown</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><p>Dimpled chin</p><h3>Brand Endorsements</h3><p>Ekta Kapoor has endorsed brands such as –</p><ul><li>EK Label</li><li>Lake Riviera Residences (2018)</li></ul><figure id=attachment_166587 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166587 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ekta Kapoor in a selfie in July 2019 (Ekta Kapoor / Instagram)</figure><h3>Best Known For</h3><ul><li>Being a prolific director and producer, having launched more than numerous Indian soap operas and movies under Balaji Telefilms, a production company her dad created</li><li>Creating a digital video-on-demand platform and app, ALTBalaji, through which she has launched numerous 40 web series</li><li>Starting Institute of Creative Excellence, a media training school, in 2012</li><li>Her social media fanbase with more than 3 million followers on Instagram, more than 600k followers on Facebook, and more than 300k followers on Twitter</li></ul><h3>As a Singer</h3><p>Ekta Kapoor sang a song named <strong>Vande Mataram</strong> alongside <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Sonu Nigam</a>, a playback singer, and composer, which was featured on the soundtrack for the action, thriller movie, Romeo Akbar Walter (2019).</p><h3>First Film</h3><p>Ekta Kapoor made her first feature film appearance as Capt.

She was an intern with a feature filmmaker, Kailash Surendranath until her dad’s company financed her aspirations as a producer.</li><li>In 2001, Asia Week magazine named her as one of “Asia’s Most Powerful Communicators”.</li><li>Because her career was on the rise, and she had to attend a plethora of business functions, Ekta hired a friend who was a designer and stylist in December 2011. She said: “I want a slight change in my look. I plan to get my teeth done, along with redoing my hair and clothes.”</li><li>When asked why she doesn’t accept to advertise brands on-screen, she admitted that she’s very shy on camera, and is always weighing her options.</li><li>In 2012, Ekta landed a spot on the list of “25 Most Powerful Women in Indian Business”.</li><li>Between 2010 and 2014, Ekta lost confidence after several of the movies she released flopped at the box office. Some of those were including Love S*x Aur Dhokha (2010), Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010), and Shor in the City (2011). This led her to be reluctant to produce the movie Half Girlfriend (2017), which ended up being profitable.</li><li>Ekta made a bold move in April 2015 when she added a ‘n*dity clause’ to the contracts of actors starring in one of her erotic movies. She wanted to have artistic freedom, and avoid actors backing out of n*de scenes and her having to make compromises.</li><li>Between 2010 and 2019, Ekta received more than 20 awards, some of which were “Woman Achiever of the Year” (2018), “Grand Achiever of the Year” (2018), “Icon of Excellence” (2018), and “HT Most Stylish Film Maker of the Year” (2019).</li><li>Ekta was named “Most Powerful Woman in Indian Business” by Business Today&nbsp;and “BW Most Influential Woman of India” by Businessworld, both in 2019.</li><li>An unnamed man stalked her in March 2019.</li><li>Her digital on-demand platform, ALT Balaji, reached a number of 20 million subscribers on August 9, 2019.</li><li>The actress <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ridhima Pandit</a> praised her for being a “magnificent woman” in late August 2019.
