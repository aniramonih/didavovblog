Although not much is known about her background, it has been reported that she was born and raised in Illinois.</p><p>Alternatively, Paul Newman was born in Shaker Heights Ohio in 1925 to the family of Theresa Garth and Arthur Sigmund Newman Sr.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jackie_Witte_Met_Paul_Newman_at_the_age_of_19></span><strong>Jackie Witte Met Paul Newman at the age of 19</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to reports, Jackie Witte and her ex-husband met when she was just 19 and he was 24. At that time, she was still in college while he was a Navy Veteran. After World War II, they both were living in a small town where they were doing summer stage work together. Later on, the pair moved to Woodstock theatre company where they worked until they got married.</p><p>On December 27, 1949, Witte and Newman tied the knot. Despite being madly in love with each other, many people thought Witte was pregnant. Thus their reason for rushing the wedding.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jackie_Witte_and_Paul_Newman_Had_Three_Children_During_Their_Marriage></span><strong>Jackie Witte and Paul Newman Had Three Children During Their Marriage</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1950, while trying to stabilize in her career, Jackie fell pregnant with their first child Scott. The birth of Scott made Newman give up his career in theatre. Jackie’s family continued to face more challenges especially when her then-father-in-law died. The whole family had to move back to Cleveland in other for Newman to help run the<a href=# rel=noopener> family business.</a></p><p><span data-offset-key=72fpq-0-0>Jackie had to put her career on hold.

He landed a role in a Broadway play which made him spend more time in Manhattan, far away from his family.</p><p>Jackie Witte’s marriage began to shatter as Newman took his acting career more seriously neglecting his role as a husband, father, and business manager.

The latter was not just carried away with his newfound fame, but he was also spending more time with a new woman he allegedly fell in love with.</p><p>The mother-of-three began to suspend that the father of her children was not only carried away with his job but with another woman called Joanne Woodward. Ironically, at the time Newman’s career skyrocketed the same time the marriage went down the drain. Jackie Witte’s husband of nine years finally opened up to her and told her he wanted a divorce.</p><p>Admitting that her husband had fallen in love with another woman was quite tough for the former model. She reportedly tried all she could to save the marriage but the Somebody Up There&nbsp;star was bent on moving with his newfound love.</p><p>Paul Newman finally made his relationship with fellow actress Woodward public shortly after he asked for a divorce from Jackie Witte. At first, she didn’t want to sign the divorce papers but after she discovered that Newman’s new woman had taken in, she gave up on the marriage.
