But once a woman hits 40, that’s no longer true.</p><p>“And the funny thing is that it actually gives a biological argument for the cougar phenomenon of an older woman selecting to be with a younger male.</p><p>“What we found astounding is that the average age of the men in the group that is not getting pregnant is relatively young. It’s not the ages that we thought.”</p><p>It is the first study to look at the impact of male age for older women and could explain why increasing numbers of women, such as director Sam Taylor-Wood, 47, are choosing younger partners. Her actor husband Aaron Johnson is just 24, and they have two children.</p><p>The researchers studied women between 40 and 46 who undertook 904 IVF cycles between 2010 and 2012. In couples where the male was 43 and a half or older, no children were born. But older women with younger partners went on to have babies.</p><p>Previous studies have shown the children of men over 55 are at greater risk of autism, bipolar disorder, low IQ and schizophrenia and are likely to be less attractive.</p><p>But the new research suggests that even in their early forties, men are already beginning to lose their fertility.</p><p>“It’s starting to occur at a very young age,” said Dr Dahan.</p><p>“If you have a 37 or 36 year old woman, probably the male age is not such a factor. But once you get to 40 and the changes that go along with reproduction in a 40-year-old woman, that’s where the male age became the factor.</p><p>“The reality is that most men are probably with women of a similar age, so as the woman is getting older, the male is also getting older.</p><p>“It suggests that once the woman is reaching 40 and the man is in his early 40s as well, that the male is having a biological clock that is contributing to their ability to have a live birth. “</p><p>Over the past 40 years the average age of childbearing in England has been increasing steadily for both men and women.</p><p>According to the Office for National Statistics the average woman gives birth just a week short of her 30th birthday while first-time mothers are also older, at just over 28. The average age of fathers is now 32 years and six months.</p><p>Women are born with all their eggs, but male sperm is constantly replicating. Each time sperm replicates there is a chance for a mutation in the DNA to occur. As men age, they are also exposed to numerous environmental toxins which have been shown to cause DNA mutations in sperm.</p><p>Molecular genetic studies have shown that the sperm of older men have far more mutations than those of younger men.</p><p>Professor Dagan Wells, a leading fertility expert at Oxford University said that older women may find it easier to get pregnant with a younger man.</p><p>"We know that the DNA in the sperm of older men suffers a loss of integrity. The DNA should be a nice long uninterrupted molecule but in older men it breaks up into little bits.</p><p>"The egg is rich in enzymes which repairs DNA damage but it could be that (as women age) that the egg is getting more challenged. There might be a tipping point."</p><p>It means that men who become fathers in their 50s or 60s are not more virile, they are just likely to have a younger partner whose egg has repaired their mutated sperm.</p><p>Professor Charles Kingsland, consultant gynecologist at Liverpool Womens NHS Foundation Trust, added: “There are biological reasons why an older woman would benefit from a younger man.</p><p>“Not only are male sperm likely to be healthier but woman live a lot longer."</p><p>The research was presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine annual meeting in Hawaii.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwv8KinKeblWR%2Bcn2XamhscF%2BJtaZ5oqisoJmiYr2psc2opJ6mn6N6uLTYZqalnJWneri7zJ6lZquYpMKtsIycn6ino5p6urvUp55mpJ%2BrsrO%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html&text=why%20older%20women%20should%20choose%20young%20lovers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html&title=why%20older%20women%20should%20choose%20young%20lovers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html&title=why%20older%20women%20should%20choose%20young%20lovers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html&title=why%20older%20women%20should%20choose%20young%20lovers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-cougar-phenomenon-why-older-women-should-choose-young-lovers-html.html&description=why%20older%20women%20should%20choose%20young%20lovers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adam-liaw.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Liaw Chef Biography, Age, Net Worth, Partner,Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-streamer-amouranths-husband-and-what-are-the-allegations-against-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is streamer Amouranths husband and what are the allegations against him?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
