He has been active since 2000, and he has numerous achievements to show for his activeness behind the turntable.</p><p>Ever since DJ Tira entered the spotlight, he has toured and played several gigs across the country. He is equally a social media sensation with a huge fan base on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Besides fame, he has made a fortune from his DJing career and other endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Summary of DJ Tira’s Personal Profile</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Real Name:</strong> Mthokozi Khathi</li><li><strong>Stage Name:</strong> DJ Tira</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> August 24, 1976</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 47 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> KwaHlabisa, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Disc Jockey, Record Producer, Kwaito Artist</li><li><strong>Best Known as:</strong> The founder of the record label Afrotainment.</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> University of KwaZulu-Natal</li></ul><h2><strong>Contrary To Popular Belief, DJ Tira Is Not A Native Of Durban&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>DJ Tira is often mistakenly assumed to be an indigene of Durban, but his real hometown is KwaHlabisa, a well-known village in KwaZulu-Natal province. He was born in the town on August 24, 1976. DJ Tira’s real name is Mthkozi Khathi while the name of his mother is Abigail Khathi.

At some point, as a student, he was able to lay his hands on some DJing gadgets and began showing off his skills at places, including Durban Youth Radio (DYR). He was popular among radio listeners at that time.</p><p>The KwaZulu-Natal-born recorder’s career got a major boost in 2001 when he released his first compilation album titled: Real Makoya. He collaborated with the late renowned South Africa DJ Khabzel on the album.</p><h2><strong>His Connection With Artist Oskido Led To His Career Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>DJ Tira’s career got into full swing in the year 2005 when he was signed by the record label, Kalawa Jazzmee. He worked closely with the CEO of the label Oskido and also performed alongside notable artists.</p><p>After he joined Kalawa Jazzmee, he began banding together with the group, Tzozo En Professor, after which he and DJ Sox went on to create a music group under Kalawa Jazzmee called Durban’s Finest. The duo has released about two compilation albums.</p><p>DJ Tira recorded another huge success in his career in 2007 when he launched his recording studio, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Afrotainment</a>. From taking charge of his production, he grew to become a music producer.</p><p>South African musical artist Sindisiwe Zungu, popularly known as DJ Cndo, was the first talent Khathi signed to his label that same year. The next set that joined Zungu in the same year was the Durban kwaito group, Big Nuz.</p><h2><strong>DJ Tira Has Banded Together With Lots Of Prominent Artists In The Industry</strong></h2><p>DJ Tira holds the record as one of the artists that discovered the Gqom music genre. Apart from Gqom, he is also into Kwaito. Some of the artists he has worked with include but is not limited to Big Nuz, C’ndo, Distruction Boyz, DJ Maphorisa, DJ Clock, Naakmusiq, Babes Wodumo, and Joocy.</p><p>Mthokozi released his first studio album captioned ‘Ezase Afro Vol:1′ in December 2008 while his latest album ’21 Years Of DJ Tira’ dropped in August 2020.</p><h4><strong>Songs from his first studio album released in 2008 include:</strong></h4><ul><li>Ungesabi</li><li>Africa, Pt 2</li><li>Tha Roxter</li><li>S’philela Ubumnandi</li><li>Won’t Let go</li></ul><h4><strong>Songs from his second studio album released in 2012 include:</strong></h4><ul><li>Samba Nabahambayo</li><li>Alikho Igama</li><li>Summertime</li><li>Thank You Mom</li><li>James</li><li>Angel</li><li>4000</li><li>Lonely</li></ul><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's going down today, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@blacklabelsa</a> match on SABC 1 at 15h00.

While some of them have walked home on several occasions with prestigious awards, the likes of Khathi have won just a handful of awards with hope and plans of winning more in the nearest future.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2020, DJ Tira has won two awards from four nominations as a professional DJ. His work, “Durban’s Finest Vol:1”, earned him his first award (Best Compilation album award) in the year 2004 at the 15th installment of the annual Metro FM Music Awards (AMFMA). He was 28 years old at the time.</p><p>He also won the Best Kwaito/Gqom/Amapiano award at the 26th Annual South African Music Awards ceremony, which took place in August 2020. The DJ clinched the award 21 years after he launched his career in the industry at the age of 44.</p><p>In 2008, DJ Tira was nominated for the Best Act Live award at the Dance Music Award South Africa (DMA SA). He was also nominated for the Record of The Year award the following year at the South African Music Award, but he lost it to another artist.</p><p>Other awards he has been nominated for as well include Mzansi Star Best Club Dj Award (2008), the South African Music Award Song of the Year for the song Umlilo, Channel O Video of the Year Award for Party 101 Teargas, (2010), and South African Music Award Song of the Year (2010).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kokstad was on fire last night.
