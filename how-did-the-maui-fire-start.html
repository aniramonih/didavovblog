Maui County reported in a statement Wednesday night that at least 36 individuals were killed in the flames.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The US Coast Guard reported that workers rescued 14 persons who had leapt into the Lahaina harbor to escape the flames. In comments to CBS Honolulu affiliate KGMB-TV, business owner Alan Dickar recounted witnessing businesses “engulfed” in flames on both sides of Front Street, a famous tourist destination.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“There were no fire trucks at that point; I think the fire department was overwhelmed,” Dickar explained to the station. Later, he told CBS News’ Patrick Torphy, “Maui can’t handle this.” Many people have lost their employment as a result of business fires. Many people were displaced from their homes. This will be disastrous for Maui.”</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Caused The Maui Fire?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>When the wildfires broke out, much of Hawaii was under a red flag warning for fire danger, but the specific cause of the inferno is still unknown.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“We don’t know what actually ignited the fires, but we were made aware in advance by the National Weather Service that we were in a red flag situation — so that’s dry conditions for a long time, so the fuel, the trees and everything, was dry,” Maj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, said at Wednesday’s briefing. That, along with low humidity and high winds, “set the conditions for the wildfires,” he said.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-52954"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/How-Did-The-Maui-Fire-Start.jpg alt="How Did The Maui Fire Start" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Hurricane Dora, which was moving across the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles south of the Hawaiian islands, was responsible for the high winds fanning the fires, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The cyclone, which the Central Pacific cyclone Center categorized as a <a href=# rel=noopener>Category 4 on Wednesday morning</a>, led to severe wind gusts of more than 60 miles per hour that ripped through Maui overnight, knocking out power lines and damaging homes.

Fires started in this manner might occur as a result of leaving campfires unattended, burning debris, utilizing various types of equipment, and inappropriately discarding cigarettes. According to the EPA, intentional acts of arson are another form of human-caused wildfires.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Wildfires are naturally caused by lightning and volcanic activity, though officials caution that lightning strikes are a considerably more common spark. Strong winds, low relative humidity, unstable atmospheric conditions, and thunderstorms all contribute to what meteorologists refer to as “fire weather,” according to Nick Nauslar, a meteorologist and former weather forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center, in a 2018 FAQ published by the agency.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-52910"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hawaii-Wildfire-Updates-1.jpg alt="How Did The Maui Fire Start?" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p style=text-align:justify>According to NOAA, wildfires can spread quickly in hot, dry, and windy conditions — especially when those conditions occur simultaneously. Most often, lightning strikes a tree and ignites a fire, but strong winds can also spark power lines, which go on to ignite wildfires when there is dry brush or grass in the area. This year’s wildfire season in Canada and across North America has been severe, as warm and dry weather persist and several parts of the continent face record heat and drought as a result of climate change.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Maui Fire officials cautioned this week that “erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes, and dropping humidity, as well as the direction and location of the fire conditions, make it difficult to predict the path and speed of a wildfire,” according to a county advisory published Tuesday. It stated that “fires can start at a far distance from their source” when wind blows embers upward and sparks ignite downwind. “The fire could be a mile or more away, but it could be at your house in a minute or two,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea in a statement included in the advisory. “Burning airborne materials can start fires far from the main body of fire.”</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Where Are The Fires In Maui?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The County of Maui stated that fire was already widespread in Lahaina, which is located in West Maui, and that traffic closures were in effect.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ROAD CLOSURES: Multiple Road Closures in Lahaina Town.
