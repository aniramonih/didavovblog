But their cousin Archie - the son of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> - is being raised as a private citizen - so will be known by his surname Mountbatten-Windsor and not as Prince Archie.</p><h2><b>Duke</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408206215.jpg><p><span>Just below the Monarch is another title - the Duke. </span><span>A Duke is a ruler</span> <span>of a ‘duchy’, which is a county, territory or domain.</span> <span>It's also tradition for men of the royal family to get a new title when they marry - often taking on Duke status.</span> <span>For example, Prince William, <a href=#>who is now the Prince of Wales</a>, previously became the <a href=#>Duke of Cambridge</a> when he married <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> (and she the Duchess of Cambridge because of his assent).</span> <span>Meanwhile, his brother Prince Harry became the <a href=#>Duke of Sussex</a> on marrying Meghan Markle, making her his Duchess.</span> <span>To become a Duke of a particular duchy, the title must be available - which happens when the last person who held the title died without legitimate heirs to take the title for themselves.</span> <span>Dukes and Duchesses should be addressed with “Your Grace”.</span></p><h2><b>Marquess</b></h2><p><span>A Marquess is the second most senior rank in the peerage, just beneath a Dukes.</span> <span>The <a href=#>Marquess</a> stands above the ranks of Earl, Viscount and Baron. The dignity of a marquess is referred to as a marquessate. At present, there are just 34 marquesses in the UK.</span> <span>A Marquess should be addressed by the phrase “My Lord”.</span></p><h2><b>Earl</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000003151986.jpg><p><span>Going down the list, just below a Marquess is an Earl.</span> <span>Members of the Royal Family further away from the crown, such as <a href=#>Prince Edward</a> (<a href=#>Earl of Wessex</a>), have been given the title in the past. However, he has since been named <a href=#>the Duke of Edinburgh</a>, a gift from Charles on his 59th birthday. </span><span>As with a Marquess, an Earl should also be addressed as “My Lord” or even “Your Lordship”.</span></p><h2><b>Viscount</b></h2><p><span>A <a href=#>Viscount</a> is the fourth rank in the British peerage system, sitting directly below an E</span><span>arl</span><span> and just above a Baron.</span> <span>There are approximately 270 viscountcies in the UK, most of whom have inherited the title.</span> <span>In British practice, the title of a Viscount may be either a place name, a surname, or a combination of the two, such as the Viscount <a href=#>Falmouth</a> or the Viscount Colville of Culross.</span> <span>Again, though, it’s correct to address viscounts with the title ‘Lord’.</span></p><h2><b>Baron</b></h2><p><span>Last, but by no means least, come the Barons.</span> <span>The term refers to those who are theoretically rulers of a barony, aka known as an administrative division of a country, of lower rank than a county.</span> <span>Barons - the female equivalent of which is a Baroness - can either be addressed as “My Lord” or “The Right Honourable”.</span> <span>The children of Barons can continue to use the title, but the wife of a Baron in her own right gains no title.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme5FwaWlwZGV8pcHKnmSemaKherG%2ByKeanmWSlr%2BwuoyrprKZnGLBqsDLnqpo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html&text=Whats%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20duke%2c%20a%20prince%2c%20an%20earl%20and%20a%20baron%3f%20%20The%20US%20Sun&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html&title=Whats%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20duke%2c%20a%20prince%2c%20an%20earl%20and%20a%20baron%3f%20%20The%20US%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html&title=Whats%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20duke%2c%20a%20prince%2c%20an%20earl%20and%20a%20baron%3f%20%20The%20US%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html&title=Whats%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20duke%2c%20a%20prince%2c%20an%20earl%20and%20a%20baron%3f%20%20The%20US%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fduke-earl-prince-baron-royal-titles.html&description=Whats%20the%20difference%20between%20a%20duke%2c%20a%20prince%2c%20an%20earl%20and%20a%20baron%3f%20%20The%20US%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-are-rheem-ac-manufactured-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where are Rheem AC manufactured?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nasim-pedrad-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Nasim Pedrad Net Worth 2024: Earnings, Career Milestones, Endorsements and more">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
