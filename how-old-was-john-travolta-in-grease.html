He grew up in a family of six children and was raised in a Roman Catholic household.</p><p>Travolta started his career in the entertainment industry at a young age. He appeared in a local theater production of “Who’ll Save the Plowboy?” at the age of 16. In 1972, he moved to New York City to pursue his career and landed a role in the Broadway musical “Grease.” He later went on to star in the film adaptation of the musical, which was released in 1978.</p><p>Travolta’s breakthrough role came in 1977 when he played Tony Manero in the movie “Saturday Night Fever.” The film was a massive success and made him a household name. Travolta’s portrayal of the disco dancer Tony Manero earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.</p><p>After the success of “Saturday Night Fever,” Travolta starred in another hit movie, “Grease,” which was released in 1978. The film was a box office success and featured Travolta as Danny Zuko, the leader of a group of greasers. The film’s soundtrack was also a hit, and Travolta’s duet with Olivia Newton-John, “You’re the One That I Want,” became a chart-topping single.</p><p>Travolta’s success continued throughout the 1980s. He starred in a number of successful films, including “Urban Cowboy,” “Blow Out,” “Staying Alive,” and “Look Who’s Talking.” However, his career took a downturn in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and he struggled to find success at the box office.</p><p>In 1994, Travolta made a comeback with his role in “Pulp Fiction,” directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film was a critical and commercial success and earned Travolta another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This role revitalized his career, and he went on to star in a number of successful movies, including “Get Shorty,” “Broken Arrow,” and “Face/Off.”</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Travolta is also a talented dancer and singer. He has released a number of albums and has had several hit singles, including “Let Her In,” “You Set My Dreams to Music,” and “Greased Lightning.” He has also performed on Broadway and in a number of musicals.</p><p>Travolta has been married twice.

Jett had a history of seizures and died at the age of 16 while on vacation in the Bahamas with his family.</p><p>Despite the personal hardships he has faced, Travolta continues to be a beloved figure in the entertainment industry. He has been recognized with numerous awards throughout his career, including a Golden Globe for his role in “Get Shorty” and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his role in “Primary Colors.” He is also a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.</p><p>Travolta is known for his charm, talent, and versatility as an actor. His career has spanned decades, and he has made a significant contribution to the entertainment industry. He continues to be a respected figure in Hollywood and an inspiration to many aspiring actors and performers around the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old was John Travolta in Grease?</h2><p>John Travolta was born on February 18, 1954.
