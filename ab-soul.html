I caught a rare virus called Steven-Johnson Syndrome. And it was very, very life-changing for me. It hindered my vision and my skin configuration. It definitely put a huge dent in my hoop dreams. I even kept trying to play. I tried to keep playing with my shades on, it was real funny when I think about it now. A lot of my friends were real cool about it. They wouldn’t make me feel different or anything like that, but I just kind of figured… I won’t have the sharp vision for that.”&nbsp;In his adolescent years however, Stevens was severely&nbsp;teased&nbsp;about his condition: “When I had got sick when I was younger of course it affected my lip skin, so coming up in school I had very dark lips and my eyes were low.
