Basically abandoning them. Pretty much wiping out all traces of black men as an earlier poster stated.</p><p>Moved to Europe with her white husband and basically don't care to have any type of interactions with her family. Not sure how true any of this is, but I've always kinda suspected that this was the case.</p><p>I guess it kinda depends what your experiences are in life. If your black and have had bad experiences with other black people, you tend to distance yourself from other black people. And if your a black person who have had a lot of issues with white people, you tend to cut white people completely out of your life and only deal with them only when you absolutely have to.</p><p>I've seen more of the latter through.</p><p>If Tina sends money to her children then that's good.
