CJ was born on 3 October 2001 in Rancho Cucamonga California.</p><p>Her children pursued their passions and careers, with CJ focusing on football. He started playing at a young age and was ranked the third highest-rated quarterback in his class at Rancho Cucamonga High School.&nbsp;</p><p>CJ went on to commit to playing for Ohio State University and was a finalist for a prestigious award for the past two years. On January 16, 2023, he decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility and enter the 2023 NFL Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with Alabama’s Bryce Young, CJ has been considered one of the top two quarterback prospects in the upcoming draft class, with Young having won the Heisman Trophy in 2021.</p><h2 id=cj-stroud-parents-story><span class=ez-toc-section id=cj-stroud-parents-story></span> CJ Stroud Parents Story <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>CJ Stroud&nbsp;parents are <strong>Coleridge Bernard Stroud III</strong> and <strong>Kimberly Stroud</strong>. CJ grew up with his siblings in a small city named Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p>His dad is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence of 38 years in upstate California. He was convicted in 2015 of multiple charges. The incident culminated in his evasion from the police by jumping into San Diego Bay.</p><p>Coleridge has already served six years at Folsom State near Sacramento. He will be eligible for parole in 2040 when he is 74.</p><p>His absence left Kimberly in a difficult situation as she struggled to support their four children financially. To make ends meet, Kimberly worked as a property manager at various locations and moved the family several times into smaller homes.</p><p>Eventually, she was faced with the possibility of eviction from a condo unit before accepting a job managing a storage facility in Upland, California.</p><p>As part of the job, the family could reside in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment above the facility’s office providing them with much-needed stability.</p><p>According to C.J.’s high school coach Mark Verti he vividly recalls dropping off C.J. at the storage facility and watching him walk up the stairs to their apartment.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kimberly-worked-multiple-jobs></span>Kimberly Worked Multiple Jobs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As stated on her LinkedIn page, Kimberly Moreland Stroud’s professional background includes working as a corrections officer at the LA County Sheriff’s Department.</p><p>In addition to her work at the Sheriff’s Department, her Facebook bio mentions her experience working at Olive Garden, a famous Italian restaurant chain. She attended Mt. San Antonio College and graduated in 1998 originally from San Dimas, California.</p><p>Her Facebook bio shows her current residence is in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Kimberly frequently shares updates about her children on Facebook and has expressed that they mean everything to her.&nbsp;</p><p>She is also active on Instagram, with a total of 78 posts, but unfortunately, her account is set to private mode, so only approved followers can see her content.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cj-fights-for-his-father></span>CJ Fights For His Father&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>CJ Stroud dad Coleridge Stroud was a pastor and often asked his son to speak to the congregation during his sermons. Coleridge also loved football.</p><p>Before he started high school, Coleridge became heavily involved in his son’s athletic life, but they didn’t always agree on a strategy.&nbsp;Coleridge was always present at practices and games but suddenly stopped showing up.&nbsp;</p><p>The 21-year-old didn’t speak to his father for more than five years after an incident that caused a rift between them. During that time, C.J. refused to talk publicly or privately about Coleridge.</p><p>However, recently C.J. has started to discuss Stroud Sr in interviews, talking about the positive things he did and expressing his anger and hurt about being abandoned.&nbsp;</p><p>The last time C.J. saw his father was in either 2014 or 2015, and Coleridge would appear sporadically and disappear for weeks.</p><p>His mother noticed a change in her son’s behavior in seventh and eighth grade, as Coleridge’s sporadic appearances began to affect him negatively. He stopped communicating with his father until a phone call about two years ago, and they now talk occasionally.</p><h2 id=cj-stroud-siblings><span class=ez-toc-section id=cj-stroud-siblings></span> CJ Stroud Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>CJ Stroud grew has two brothers named&nbsp;<strong>Asmar</strong>, <strong>Isaiah </strong>and a sister <strong>Cieara Stroud</strong>. His older brother, Isaiah Stroud is a navy officer.</p><p>On September 10, 2013, Kimberly, their mother, posted a picture of Isaiah in his Navy uniform on Facebook, expressing her pride in her son’s accomplishments. On Veterans Day, CJ’s grandmother, Olga Boykin, also posted a picture of Isaiah and thanked him for his service.</p><p>Aside from this, Isaiah is married to his wife, Sydney, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, on September 7, 2017, weighing around 7 lbs, 1 oz, and 20 inches long.</p><p>On the other hand, CJ’s second older brother, Asmar Stroud, was present at the Heisman Ceremony on December 11, 2021. Meanwhile, Asmar’s social media pages are untraceable, but his grandmother has posted multiple images of him while wishing him a happy birthday.</p><p>According to her Facebook profile, CJ’s sister, Cieara Stroud, resides in Pomona, California. Not many pictures are available on her social media page, but all four siblings have a great bond, and the older three have supported CJ’s football career.&nbsp;</p><p>They are often spotted at the stands attending his football matches and have also been present at awards functions where CJ won championships.</p><h2 id=cj-stroud-family-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=cj-stroud-family-life></span> CJ Stroud Family Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>CJ family includes his grandparents and uncle Damon. His grandmother studied at California State University in Long Beach.</p><p>The family is originally from Los Angeles, California, but they now reside in Carson, California, a suburb located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County.</p><p>Stroud grew up in a quiet involved family in their church, with his father serving as pastor and his mother as the first lady at Life Application Christian Center in Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p>As the youngest of four siblings, C.J. spent much of his childhood helping to build the church’s foundation., according to Fox Sports.&nbsp;</p><p>He played football for the Alta Loma Warriors and Pomona Steelers youth teams, and his coaches recognized his talent as a quarterback and suggested he could earn a scholarship.</p><p>However, C.J.’s love for basketball remained strong, and he played for the Rancho Cucamonga Cougars high school team as a point guard, leading them to a CIF Division II runner-up finish in 2018.</p><p>While his basketball skills were impressive, his parents needed help to afford the time commitment and financial burden of playing high-level AAU basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, C.J. continued to excel in both sports, eventually committing to play football at Ohio State University.</p><p>C.J.’s upbringing emphasized the importance of community service and being selfless, as his family spent much time volunteering in their neighborhood and community.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother emphasized the importance of her children understanding that there is a big world outside of themselves. The stroud family awaits the glorious moment in the NFL draft 2023 when Cj’s name will be called.</p><p>The Pro-ready quarterback will most probably go number one overall to Carolina Panthers replacing 49ers-bound Sam Darnold. Or 2nd to Houston Texans unless the two teams gamble on Anthony Richardson’s unlimited ceiling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuaYsC1vs6um2aln6J6rLXMm5yrpKliwLW%2Bzq6bZpmemXq0tcGloKefo2LAqa3RnmStoJViu6e4jKCmmqSjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html&text=CJ%20Stroud%20Mom%20Kimberly%20Stroud%20and%20Siblings%20Share%20The%20NFL%20Goals&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html&title=CJ%20Stroud%20Mom%20Kimberly%20Stroud%20and%20Siblings%20Share%20The%20NFL%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html&title=CJ%20Stroud%20Mom%20Kimberly%20Stroud%20and%20Siblings%20Share%20The%20NFL%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html&title=CJ%20Stroud%20Mom%20Kimberly%20Stroud%20and%20Siblings%20Share%20The%20NFL%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcj-stroud-mom-kimberly-stroud-and-siblings-share-the-nfl-goals.html&description=CJ%20Stroud%20Mom%20Kimberly%20Stroud%20and%20Siblings%20Share%20The%20NFL%20Goals" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./colleen-ballinger-fart-joke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colleen Ballinger Fart Joke: Youtubers Old Show Video Leads to Serious Drama, lost Sponsorship De">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chip-gaines-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chip Gaines Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
