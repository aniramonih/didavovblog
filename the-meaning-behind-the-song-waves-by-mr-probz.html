Released in 2013, the song has since gained international recognition. It has been streamed over 1 billion times on Spotify and even earned the Dutch singer-songwriter a number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The success of “Waves” is due, in no small part, to its deeply emotional lyrics that explore themes of heartbreak, hope, and the power of moving on.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Genesis_of_%E2%80%9CWaves%E2%80%9D></span>The Genesis of “Waves”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mr. Probz, whose real name is Dennis Stehr, wrote “Waves” in 2010 while he was still relatively unknown. The song was originally just a guitar riff with a few lyrics, but it evolved into something much more profound. Stehr was inspired to write the song after a particularly difficult time in his life. His long-term girlfriend had left him and he was feeling lost and alone. There was a sense of emptiness that he couldn’t shake. Stehr turned to music, his first love, as a way to express his emotions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Lyrics></span>The Lyrics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lyrics of “Waves” are captivating from the first line. The song is both tender and robust and captures the rollercoaster of emotions that Stehr was going through at the time of its writing. The song begins:</p><p>“My face above the water, my feet can’t touch the ground,<br>Touch the ground, and it feels like<br>I can see the sands on the horizon every time you are not around”</p><p>These opening lines paint an image of someone treading water, trying to keep their head above the surface, while feeling isolated and lost. The chorus goes on to express the hope of moving on:</p><p>“I’m slowly drifting away (drifting away)<br>Wave after wave, wave after wave<br>I’m slowly drifting (drifting away)<br>And it feels like I’m drowning,<br>Pulling against the stream”</p><p>The lyrics are both descriptive and emotive, with each word conveying a sense of the complex emotions that are being explored.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Music></span>The Music<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The music of “Waves” also plays a significant role in the emotional journey of the song. The melody is slow and reflective, emphasizing the introspective nature of the lyrics. The song’s producer, Dutch DJ and producer Robin Schulz, took Stehr’s original stripped-back version and gave it a more upbeat, electronic beat. This contrasts starkly with the pain expressed in the lyrics, but it creates a beautiful dichotomy that adds to the emotional depth of the song.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_Behind_the_Song></span>The Meaning Behind the Song<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The overarching meaning behind “Waves” is about overcoming heartbreak. The image of waves is used throughout the song as a metaphor for the emotional journey of moving on. Stehr is saying that life is like a stream, and sometimes we are pulled in different directions. Sometimes we feel as though we are drowning, but we must push against the stream and keep moving forward. The song is about finding a way to accept the pain of losing someone and using that pain to grow.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Significance_of_%E2%80%9CWaves%E2%80%9D></span>The Significance of “Waves”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Waves” has become a musical classic, and its message has resonated with millions of people. Stehr’s heart-wrenching lyrics, combined with Schulz’s electronic beats, created something powerful. The song has been described as a “tale of human emotion” and a “journey of heartbreak”. This has earned it a place in many people’s hearts as a song that helps them through tough times.</p><p>In a world where we are often encouraged to suppress our emotions, “Waves” is a reminder that it’s okay to feel pain and that it is possible to heal and move on. It is a song that speaks to the human experience and has become a beacon of hope for many.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Closing_Thoughts></span>Closing Thoughts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Waves” is not just a song, it’s a journey of emotions that many of us can relate to. It is a reminder that we will all experience heartbreak, but it’s how we deal with that pain that will shape who we become. The song has resonated with millions of people worldwide, and it will undoubtedly continue to inspire and help others for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG7DwK%2BcrGWSrnquvoypqaiaqmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html&text=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Waves%20by%20Mr.%20Probz&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Waves%20by%20Mr.%20Probz" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Waves%20by%20Mr.%20Probz" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html&title=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Waves%20by%20Mr.%20Probz" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-waves-by-mr-probz.html&description=The%20Meaning%20Behind%20The%20Song%3a%20Waves%20by%20Mr.%20Probz" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./traveling-nurse-from-michigan-missing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Traveling nurse from Michigan last seen hiking in California is still missing">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jake-gyllenhaal-streaming-netflix-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Heartbreaking Jake Gyllenhaal Military Movie Streaming On Netflix">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
