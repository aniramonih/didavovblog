Her love affair with one of the most notorious serial killers of our time made headlines as the pair’s romance took center stage during one of the most watched trials in history.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Carole Anne Boone for all intents and purposes looked like any other average 1980s Washington state woman. Yet beneath her unassuming exterior hid a woman whose claim to fame would make her stand out in any crowd. Carole Ann Boone was in love with notorious serial killer Ted Bundy.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-carole-ann-boone data-injectable=false>Who is Carole Ann Boone?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oxygen.jpg><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>In 1974, a softspoken woman in her late 20s, Carole Ann Boone would meet someone who would alter the course of her life forever. Although she wouldn’t become his wife until six years later, the two would begin a friendship that would eventually turn into much more. It was in this year Boone met Theodore Robert Bundy, aka Ted Bundy.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Ted Bundy was one of the most notorious serial killers in American history, with a reported 36 murders (possibly more) attributed to him. The two met when they both worked at the Department of Emergency Services in Olympia, Washington.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Bundy appeared to be anything else than what the masses know him as now. “I liked Ted immediately,” she was quoted as saying in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Only Living Witness: The True Story of Serial Sex Killer Ted Bundy</a>&nbsp;by Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. “He struck me as being a rather shy person with a lot more going on under the surface.”</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>If only she knew then how right she was. The two developed a friendship even as Bundy was secretly kidnapping and murdering women. Over the years, their friendship developed into a romantic entanglement and when Bundy went on trial for murder in Florida, Boone was there to support him. In fact, she would do more than stand by him, she married him!</p><h2 id=h-bundy-with-boone-by-his-side-faces-the-consequences data-injectable=false>Bundy, with Boone by his side faces the consequences</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Bundy was first arrested in Utah in 1975, but Boone held fast to her belief he was innocent of the crimes he was accused of. Despite the mounting evidence against him and even eyewitness accounts, Boone’s feelings for Bundy only grew. By 1979, Bundy was on trial for his life in Florida after allegedly murdering several members of the Chi Omega sorority.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>During the trial, which was one of the most followed in history, the two got married. In a bizarre display of affection in the courtroom, Ted Bundy, while representing himself, proposed marriage to Boone while she was on the witness stand. A display of affection is counted as a legally binding contract in Florida law. And in that moment, Ted Bundy had just gotten married.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Boone would go on to become pregnant with Bundy’s child during a visit with him on death row. In 1981, Rose, aka Rosa Bundy, <a href=#>Ted Bundy’s only known child, was born</a>. Boone held firm to her belief in his innocence all the way until 1986.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>As his execution date neared, Bundy offered to show the families where the bodies of their murdered daughters were in exchange for a stay of execution. Boone then realized in order to know where the bodies were, Bundy would have indeed had to murder them. The two divorced and Bundy was executed in 1989.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Carole Ann Boone now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-24-165033.png><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Carole Ann Boone was the legal wife of Ted Bundy and the mother of his child. Following their divorce, she moved back to Washington State, taking their daughter with her. Following the move, little is known about her whereabouts.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>She and her daughter understandably dropped off the grid and out of the public eye. Many felt they might have even changed their names for a time. Ann Rule, the famous true crime writer, author of The Stranger Beside Me, and a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> former friend of Bundy’s</a> reported to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oxygen</a> that Rose was “kind and intelligent.”</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Many documentaries, movies, and series have been made about Bundy, many of which shed even more light on the odd romance between him and Carole Ann Boone. Although Bundy had several other women in his life, most notably Liz Kendall as explored in the popular Zac Efron Netflix film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</a>, he was only ever legally married to Boone and she was the mother of his only known child.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zac Efron (@zacefron)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>According to reports by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Health</a>, Carole Ann Boone died in a retirement home in 2018 at the age of 70.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>It was an odd romance to be sure, and one that would keep Boone’s name in the headlines for years to come.
