In addition, he is well-known for being the nephew of the late artist Selena Quintanilla and the son of American record producer A. B. Quintanilla. It is a known truth that the president of the Selena Fan Club killed Selena when she was 23 years old.</strong></p><p>He’s already contributed to some successful tracks as a professional. However, what is his life like outside of his career? Does he have a girlfriend or is he married? We will go into great detail regarding his parents, profession, net worth, and much more in this post.</p><h2><span id=AB_Quintanilla_III8217s_Son_Is_Savani_Quintanilla>A.B. Quintanilla III’s Son Is Savani Quintanilla</span></h2><p>Savani Quintanilla, an American record producer, was born in Texas on November 27, 1991, to parents A.B. Quintanilla III and Evangelina Almeida. Although he goes by Svani Quintanilla by birth, he is most known in the public by his stage moniker, principle q.</p><p>In addition to being a great musician and composer, his father is also a record producer. He has released a number of popular singles and albums as a musician, including “Como la Flor,” “Amor Prohibido,” “No Me Queda Más,” and many more.</p><h2><span id=Brothers_and_Sisters>Brothers and Sisters</span></h2><p>Savani, also known as Svani, is one of Quintanilla’s eight children, born into several partnerships. Gianni, Svani’s biological brother, was born in 2000.</p><p>Similarly, he was the product of his father’s several relationships and has six additional siblings. Unfortunately, he has not shared much information about his siblings—aside from Martika, his half-sister born in 2000 as a result of his father’s union with Vangie.</p><h2><span id=His_Father_Is_In_Three_Marriages>His Father Is In Three Marriages</span></h2><p>The father of Savani had many marriages. He was wed to Evangelina Almeida initially. Regretfully, they did not have a very long marriage.</p><p>On November 12, 2011, he later wed Rikkie Leigh Robertson, his girlfriend, for the second time. Before getting married, the pair supposedly dated for a time. However, on July 5, 2016, they also declared their divorce.</p><p>As of right now, A.B. and Anjelah O., an Argentinian woman, are blissfully married. On September 16, 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, the pair exchanged vows.</p><p>Savani Quintanilla works as an engineer and producer.</p><p>As we previously said, Savani is a well-known musician, record producer, and sound engineer. He has had a number of hit singles thus far. In addition, he shares ownership of alebrije.tx.</p><p>He has worked with a number of musicians throughout the years to create new renditions of Selena’s songs. In addition, he works as a DJ and has occasionally performed at local events and clubs.</p><h2><span id=The_Quintanilla_Savani_Boyfriend_Marriage_Kids>The Quintanilla Savani Boyfriend, Marriage, Kids</span></h2><p>Savani’s romantic life is, of course, the least discussed topic. Information on his romantic relationships is scarce. He is in his forties, yet he has kept everything about his romantic life private from the press.</p><p>Nobody is aware of whether he is currently dating or married. One thing is certain, though: he is the father of a son named Yvie. Regretfully, he has not disclosed the identity of his child’s mother.</p><p>He publishes his son’s pictures on social media frequently and they have a good relationship.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_His_Total_Net_Worth>What Is His Total Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Savani hardly discusses his financial situation in public. Sources believe that even though he has not disclosed his income, he must have a few thousand dollars in net worth.</p><p>However, with a $5 million net worth, his father is rather well-off.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>In case you were unaware, Savani is an avid user of Instagram. He uses the site frequently, and the most of his posts are on his career. He had more than 10.7k Instagram followers as of 2021.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://popularbio.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Engineer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Filmmaker</a> <a href=# rel=tag>record producer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Dove Cameron Trans | Sexuality Partner And Gender</a></h3>Dove Cameron is a gifted American singer and actor who was born Chloe Celeste Hosterman on January 15, 1996.
