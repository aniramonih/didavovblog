She met him through his sister, and the first time they crossed paths, they were both in treatment for track injuries.</p><p>Before marrying Walker, Grossman lived a private life as a businesswoman. All that changed after she married Walker, as she became a public figure. Their marriage pleased many because they seemed happy on the outside, but as time passed, some horrific things started happening behind closed doors.&nbsp;</p><p>It led to a divorce that came after about two decades. Keep reading to learn more about Cindy Deangelis Grossman and what she endured in her marriage to Herschel Walker.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hersch-fotor-2023092914017-695x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Herschel_Walkers_Ex-Wifes_Name></span>What Is Herschel Walker’s Ex-Wife’s Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Herschel Walker’s ex-wife’s name is Cindy Deangelis Grossman. She was born in Florida on January 6, 1962, to Thomas DeAngelis, who worked in real estate and reportedly hails from Cocoa Beach.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Herschel_Walker_Still_Married_to_His_First_Wife></span>Is Herschel Walker Still Married to His First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No. Herschel Walker is no longer married to his first wife, Cindy Deangelis Grossman. The pair went their separate ways in 2002 because of the former NFL star’s mental illness.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Long_Was_Herschel_Walker_Married_to_His_First_Wife></span>How Long Was Herschel Walker Married to His First Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Herschel Walker and his first wife were married for 19 years. The couple reportedly exchanged marital vows on March 31, 1983, and parted in 2002.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Cindy_Deangelis_Grossman_Leave_Herschel_Walker></span>Why Did Cindy Deangelis Grossman Leave Herschel Walker?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cindy Deangelis Grossman married Herschel Walker at age 21, but she had to leave him when he started doing things that endangered her life. Grossman said in 2008 that Walker got a gun, put it to her temple, and threatened to blow her “brains out.” He did not deny it, telling ABC then that he had no recollection of the incident but said he “probably did it.”</p><p>This was not a one-time occurrence. According to The Associated Press, documents “detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life. Also, he has been vocal about struggling with mental health issues for years.</p><p>In December 2005, Grossman obtained a protective order against Walker, alleging “violent and controlling behavior.” The order came after Grossman felt threatened because Walker was unhappy she was seeing other men.</p><p>According to reports, Grossman admitted in court that she got calls from her sister and father, both of whom Walker had contacted. He told them that he would murder her and her new man. Walker has stated that he suffered from dissociative identity disorder, blaming his actions on the mental illness.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hersh.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cindy_Deangelis_Grossman_Recorded_an_Ad_Against_Him></span>Cindy Deangelis Grossman Recorded an Ad Against Him <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>More <a href=#>sordid details</a> of their time together came out after Walker started his political career. He was running for the United States Senate in Georgia when his former wife took it upon herself to tell the world why she believed he did not deserve the position.&nbsp;</p><p>Grossman went as far as recording an anti-Herschel Walker ad for a PAC in the U.S. Senate race. She said: “His eyes would become very evil … The guns and knives. I got into a few choking things with him.”&nbsp;</p><p>Walker <a href=#>responded </a>to the ad by saying, “People told me politics was dirty. They’re right. My opponents launched a dirty attack ad. They dug up an old video and took it out of context.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Cindy_Grossman_Married></span>Is Cindy Grossman Married?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not long after divorcing Walker, Grossman married another man. However, his identity has not been divulged by the businesswoman.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is not because she still worries about Walker going after her man. The NFL player seems to have moved on, too. He is married to Julie Blanchard and has been since they tied the knot in 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/schel.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cindy_Deangelis_Grossman_Height></span>Cindy Deangelis Grossman Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Grossman is reportedly 5′ 5″ or 165 centimeters tall. She weighs about 132 pounds or 60 kilograms and has hazel eyes and luscious dark brown hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cindy_Deangelis_Grossman_Kids></span>Cindy Deangelis Grossman Kids&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While married, Grossman and Herschel Walker welcomed a son named Christian. He was born in 1999 and is a social media influencer famous for his conservative rants.&nbsp;</p><p>Christian also spoke up against his father in a tweet that saw him reveal that they all warned Walker to avoid going for a political post so his dirty laundry would not be made public. Walker chose not to listen, and when things got publicized, Christian ranted about how terrible the former NFL player was as a father.&nbsp;</p><p>Walker eventually lost his bid for senate to Raphael Warnock, but who’s to say that is where his political ambition ends? Other famous faces like Walker, who have at some point battled mental health issues or still do, include <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>, Kurt Cobain, and Kid Cudi.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKq6w7JknZ2Ro7SmuMisZKCqn6jArq3NZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdqbxutMSrqpyglaF6uK3LpJyrq12axW7DyJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html&text=Cindy%20Deangelis%20Grossman%3a%20What%20Happened%20to%20Herschel%20Walker%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html&title=Cindy%20Deangelis%20Grossman%3a%20What%20Happened%20to%20Herschel%20Walker%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html&title=Cindy%20Deangelis%20Grossman%3a%20What%20Happened%20to%20Herschel%20Walker%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html&title=Cindy%20Deangelis%20Grossman%3a%20What%20Happened%20to%20Herschel%20Walker%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcindy-deangelis-grossman-what-happened-to-herschel-walkers-ex-wife.html&description=Cindy%20Deangelis%20Grossman%3a%20What%20Happened%20to%20Herschel%20Walker%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cindy-makhathini-biography-age-pictures-instagram-net-worth-parents-spouse-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cindy Makhathini Biography: Age, Pictures, Instagram, Net Worth, Parents, Spouse, Boyfriend">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./655a26d5268e3e62068b45bf-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Checo Perez wonders what might have been: The reasons why he couldn't win the Las Vegas GP">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
