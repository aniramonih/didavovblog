They later appeared in the <a href=#>June 2013 music video</a> for the song alongside child actors portraying younger versions of themselves.</p><p>Flash forward 10 years, Swift was featured on Sheeran’s February 2022 track “The Joker And the Queen.” The song was a full-circle moment for the celebrity pals, as <strong>Ava Ames</strong> and <strong>Jack Lewis</strong> — the “Everything Has Changed” child actors — once again portrayed versions of Sheeran and Swift <a href=#>in the music video</a>.</p><p>“She would be there if everything ended for me,” Sheeran told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in March 2017. “Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense. She’s omnipresent because she’s the most famous woman in the world, so she can’t make the decision to not be in the press. <a href=#>I always stick up for Taylor</a>.”</p><p>Scroll below to see the best moments from Swift and Sheeran’s friendship:</p><h3>October 2012</h3><p>Two months after the release of “Everything Has Changed,” Swift and Sheeran performed the track for the first time at the 2012 Jingle Ball that December.</p><h3>March 2013</h3><p>Sheeran served as Swift’s opening act for the North American of her Red tour. The same month the two hit the road, Sheeran <a href=#>shut down romantic speculation</a> between him and the “All Too Well” singer.</p><p>He told New Zealand’s TVNZ that while he had spent the night in a hotel room with Swift, he was only showing her new music. “I did stay there ’til four and I did leave in the same clothes, but I was playing her my new record. It was strictly that kind of thing,” he clarified. “Literally, I went in there and we passed the guitar back and forth and played songs to each other.”</p><p>Sheeran went on to joke: “The thing that impressed me with the media is that because they wrote about it, my mates believed it. And my mates are texting me being like, ‘Is it true?’ So I said it wasn’t but the fact that people can believe it makes me feel like a bit of a stud, you know?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Taylor-Swift-and-Ed-Sheerans-Best-Friendship-Moments-Over-the-Years-Collabs-Performances-and-More7.jpg><h3>August 2013</h3><p>Swift poked fun at her infamous 2009 VMAs moment with <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> in message <a href=#>she wrote on a jar of jam</a> she gifted Sheeran for his birthday. “Yo Ed — I’m really 4 you and I’m gonna let u finish but this is the best JAM OF ALL TIME,” <a href=#>the jar read</a>.</p><h3>June 2014</h3><p>After many speculated Sheeran’s song “Don’t” was about a possible romantic betrayal from Swift, he clarified in an interview with <a href=#>Parade Magazine</a> that the tune was “<a href=#>about someone who’s well known</a>, but not Taylor.” The article noted that the song was also rumored to be about <a href=#><strong>Ellie Goulding</strong></a>.</p><h3>December 2014</h3><p>Swift and Sheeran were among many celebrity performers at the <a href=#>2014 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show</a>. Though they performed their respective tracks “Blank Space” and “Thinking Out Loud” separately, they stood together during the show’s curtain call.</p><h3>February 2016</h3><p>Swift <a href=# rel>jumped up from her seat</a>&nbsp;to congratulate Sheeran after <a href=#>he beat her for Song of the Year</a> at the 2016 Grammys. Days later, she <a href=#>penned a sweet birthday tribute</a> for her friend via Instagram.</p><p>“I don’t think he ever knew how inspired I was by his drive and passion to constantly create new art,” Swift wrote. “But it’s his 25th birthday today, so I’m saying it now. You deserve everything you have, and everything you will continue to achieve, Ed.”</p><h3>July 2016</h3><p>Neighbors of Swift’s Rhode Island residence captured audio of the BFFs duetting <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>’ “… Baby One More Time” <a href=#>at her 2016 Fourth of July party</a>.</p><h3>January 2017</h3><p>“Taylor was never the popular kid in school. I was never the popular kid in school,” Sheeran told <a href=#>British GQ</a> of his ad Swift’s career successes. “Then you get to the point when you become the most popular kid in school — and <a href=#>we both take it a bit too far</a>.”</p><p>He continued: “She wants to be the biggest female artist in the world and I want to be the biggest male artist in the world. It also comes from always being told that you can’t do something and being like, ‘F–k you. I can.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Taylor-Swift-and-Ed-Sheerans-Best-Friendship-Moments-Over-the-Years-Collabs-Performances-and-More4.jpg><h3>April 2017</h3><p>Swift <a href=#>paid tribute to Sheeran</a> in an essay for that year’s Time Magazine‘s <a href=#>“100 Most Influential People”</a> edition.</p><p>“A few years ago, in a rare moment of admitting feeling defeated, Ed said to me, ‘I’m never going to win a Grammy.’ ‘Yes, you are,’ I said. ‘You’re going to sweep the whole thing one of these years,’” she wrote. “It was a few weeks later when he met me in a dance-shoe store in London, where I was picking out rehearsal outfits, and said, ‘You have to hear this.’ It was a song he’d just finished called ‘Thinking Out Loud,’ which went on to win Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in 2016.”</p><p>Swift went on to state that Sheeran is “protected by an impenetrable and ever-present armor of enthusiasm that has helped him endure any setback, letdown or underestimation.”</p><h3>November 2017</h3><p>The pair collaborated once more on Swift’s sixth studio album, <a href=#>Reputation</a>, on the track “Endgame,” which also featured <a href=#><strong>Future</strong></a>. Just like they did with “Everything Has Changed” the friends performed “Endgame” for the first time at that years’ <a href=#>iHeartRadio Jingle Ball</a>.</p><p>Both Sheeran and Future appeared alongside Swift in <a href=#>the song’s music video</a> released in January 2018.</p><h3>September 2018</h3><p>Swift and Sheeran <a href=#>poked fun at the fact</a> they were both nominated in the same category for that year’s <a href=#>American Music Awards</a> in a hilarious <a href=#>Instagram</a> video.</p><p>“Taylor, the AMA nominations came out. It’s me, you and <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a>,” Sheeran told Swift. They each responded by telling the other, “You’re going to win,” before admitting they think “Drake’s going to win.”</p><p>Filmed while taking a hike together, Swift jokingly asked Sheeran, “It’s called exercise. Have you ever done cardio? Strumming a guitar doesn’t count.”</p><h3>July 2019</h3><p>After <a href=#>Swift’s masters were purchased</a> by <a href=#><strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a>, fans criticized Sheeran for not immediately speaking out in Swift’s defense. He eventually <a href=#>broke his silence via Instagram</a> after a fan came to his defense in a post’s comments section.</p><p>“Just because he didn’t post anything it doesn’t mean he is not supporting her, maybe he’s talking with her right now, who knows,” the user wrote, to which Sheeran replied, “I have been speaking directly to her, like I always do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Taylor-Swift-and-Ed-Sheerans-Best-Friendship-Moments-Over-the-Years-Collabs-Performances-and-More2.jpg><h3>November 2021</h3><p>A new version of “Everything Has Changed” was featured on Swift’s rerecorded version of <a href=#>Red</a>. Sheeran was also featured on one of the album’s vault tracks titled “Run.”</p><h3>February 2022</h3><p>“Joker And The Queen” debuted.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>August 2023</h3><p>Following the announcement of the <a href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a>, Sheeran addressed fan speculation regarding whether he and Swift had already rerecorded “Endgame” for Reputation (Taylor’s Version).</p><p>“No, I haven’t. No. No,” he said on <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>’s <a href=#>“Deep & Shallow” Sirius XM podcast</a>, confirming that they will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlrulecSdZKyglZq%2ForrSZpmeq6Ris7O1xKebrKCZpXquu8yepa2rXaTDpr6MrZ%2BeZamarrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Ed%20Sheeran%27s%20Best%20Friendship%20Moments%20Over%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Ed%20Sheeran%27s%20Best%20Friendship%20Moments%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Ed%20Sheeran%27s%20Best%20Friendship%20Moments%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Ed%20Sheeran%27s%20Best%20Friendship%20Moments%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-and-ed-sheerans-best-friendship-moments-over-the-years.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20and%20Ed%20Sheeran%27s%20Best%20Friendship%20Moments%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./67089-the-beastie-boys-coined-the-mullet-hairstyle-and-now-im-a-changed-man.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Beastie Boys Coined The Mullet Hairstyle And Now I'm A Changed Man">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tabitha-brown-vegan-husband-chance-brown-find-her-wiki-age-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tabitha Brown (Vegan) Husband Chance Brown Find Her Wiki, Age, Kids">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
