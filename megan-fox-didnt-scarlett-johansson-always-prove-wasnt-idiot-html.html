But if there’s one thing that Fox can’t stand, it’s having to prove her intelligence to her fans. Something she accused Scarlett Johansson of doing on more than one occasion.</p><h2 id=h-why-megan-fox-hated-being-called-sexy>Why Megan Fox hated being called ‘sexy’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Megan-Fox.jpg><p id=par-2_33>Some would find being called sexy a compliment, but Megan Fox revealed that she grew tired of the label. In fact, she can’t help but feel the term is more humiliating than endearing.</p><p id=par-3_78>“I just don’t like being called sexy. It embarrasses me,” Fox told People (via<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mirror</a>.) “I’m in a situation where I get lots of compliments all the time. I’m very lucky. People tell me that I am beautiful and that I am sexy all day but I hate it. I don’t know how to react. It’s embarrassing. How would you feel if people called you the most sexy person in the world ALL day? It’s strange, you know.”</p><p id=par-4_17>Despite the recognition she’s received due to her looks, Fox was uncertain if she deserved the accolades.</p><p id=par-5_60>“I’m not sure if I deserve to win all these awards for sexiest female or most beautiful woman in the world, honestly,” she said. “I got lucky because I was picked to be in <a href=#>the Transformers movie</a> and it was a successful movie which made hundreds of millions of dollars and that meant my image went all around the world.”</p><p id=par-6_20>However, Fox also began to believe there was another detriment to her looks and the reputation that came with them.</p><h2 id=h-megan-fox-didn-t-want-to-constantly-prove-she-was-smart-like-scarlett-johansson-had-to>Megan Fox didn’t want to constantly prove she was smart like Scarlett Johansson had to</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_21>Megan Fox once commented that she didn’t feel that actors, in general, were that smart. At least the majority of them.</p><p id=par-8_36>“Actors aren’t necessarily the most intelligent guys you’ve ever come across,” Fox said according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC Washington</a>. “They’re so easily manipulated that if you have any sort of control over your own sexuality, they’re just f****.”</p><p id=par-9_60>Fox later revealed how she was working to handle her own status as a sex icon. One of the drawbacks of that status was, she felt, having to constantly prove she was smart to her audience. It was an offense she accused her fellow actor Scarlett Johansson of doing, and she didn’t want to follow the <a href=#>Black Widow star’s</a> lead.</p><p id=par-10_83>“I don’t want to have to be like a Scarlett Johansson,” Fox once said. “Who I have nothing against – but I don’t want to have to go on talk shows and pull out every single SAT word I’ve ever learned to prove, like, ‘Take me seriously, I am intelligent, I can speak.’ I don’t want to have to do that. I resent having to prove that I’m not a retard – but I do. And part of it is my own fault.”</p><p id=par-11_22>Taylor Swift was another celebrity Fox claimed she didn’t want to be like. But for different reasons than she had with Fox.</p><p id=par-12_24>“Because I’m young and female, people want me to be like <a href=#>some Disney Channel</a>, supersafe, sex-before-marriage-is-bad, Taylor Swift, I-date-someone-with-a-promise ring, bulls*** girl,” she confided.</p><h2 id=h-megan-fox-was-told-to-be-less-sexy>Megan Fox was told to be less sexy</h2><p id=par-13_39>Although she once claimed she didn’t like being called sexy, Fox is also someone who embraces her sexuality. So when she was told to be less sexy to get more acting gigs, the <a href=#>Jennifer’s Body actor</a> refused to comply.</p><p id=par-14_36>“Everyone wanted me to look like a movie star so that I could land this role,” Fox once said according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grazia</a>. “I resent people trying to tell me how to look, or act, or speak.”</p><p id=par-15_25>She later explained one of the benefits of starring in a film like Jennifer’s Body was that the director wasn’t trying to tone her down.</p><p id=par-16_44>“She’s not trying to hide me. People were trying to hide me and make me less sexy so that I could be taken more seriously,” she said. “And I don’t give a single f*** about that. I just want the look to be right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6prPAp2Sfp6hisaqwza1krJuRp7mmwNNmoaigkaPAtLvNZpilr5GuwG680aitnmWnlsCvwIyim6KnpGO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html&text=Megan%20Fox%20Didn%27t%20Like%20How%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20Had%20to%20Always%20Prove%20She%20Wasn%27t%20an%20Idiot&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html&title=Megan%20Fox%20Didn%27t%20Like%20How%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20Had%20to%20Always%20Prove%20She%20Wasn%27t%20an%20Idiot" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html&title=Megan%20Fox%20Didn%27t%20Like%20How%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20Had%20to%20Always%20Prove%20She%20Wasn%27t%20an%20Idiot" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html&title=Megan%20Fox%20Didn%27t%20Like%20How%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20Had%20to%20Always%20Prove%20She%20Wasn%27t%20an%20Idiot" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmegan-fox-didnt-scarlett-johansson-always-prove-wasnt-idiot-html.html&description=Megan%20Fox%20Didn%27t%20Like%20How%20Scarlett%20Johansson%20Had%20to%20Always%20Prove%20She%20Wasn%27t%20an%20Idiot" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-patrick-king.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Patrick King Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mcskillet-biography-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="McSkillet Biography And Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
