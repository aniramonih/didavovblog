She is winning the audience's heart since her debut in 1996 with her brilliant acting skills and performance on the screen.</p><p>Theron was born on 7th August 1975 in Benoni, South Africa, to her Afrikaner family. She is of Caucasian ethnicity and holds dual nationality (American and South African).&nbsp;</p><h2>Charlize's Current Affair with Brad Pitt</h2><p>Charlize has faced lost of ups and downs in her love life. She went through the numbers of failed relationships. But she never let her expectations down and went on dating numbers of guys.&nbsp;</p><p>The star is currently dating famous American actor Brad Pitt. The pair was first spotted in late 2018.</p><p>As per reports, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pitt was watching If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, where Theron was invited as a special guest. Brad then joined Charlize in the bar, and both seemed very close as Pitt was holding her in his arms and winked at Theron. As a matter of fact, the two were introduced by a celebrity mutual friend, <strong>Sean Penn </strong>(Charlize's ex-fiance).</p><h2>Charlize Theron's Past Affair With Stephan Jenkins</h2><p>Multi-Award winning actress was previously in a romantic relationship with American singer <strong>Stephan Jenkins</strong>. The duo started dating in October 1998 after a few meetings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Stephan%20Jenkins-1573807327830.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the pair decided to break-up after dating for three years in October 2001. Both of them went separate ways with no explanation behind their split.&nbsp;</p><h2>Relationship With Stuart Townsend</h2><p>Almost after a year of her separation with Stephan, Charlize met <strong>Stuart Townsend</strong> on the set of Trapped in 2002. The lovebirds soon fell in love and started living together in Los Angeles and later moved to Ireland.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Stuart-1573807386859.jpg><p>The duo was going great until they began facing personal issues. After years of togetherness, the pair decided to end their eight years of relationship in January 2010.</p><h2>Unsuccessful Love life with Sean Penn</h2><p>The South African actress stayed single for more than three years after her split with Stuart. But in December 2013, she met actor <strong>Sean Penn </strong>during the shooting of the movie and eventually fell in love.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Sean%20Penn-1573807456784.jpg><p>Theron and Penn also announced their engagement in December 2014, but after a year, they called off their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then Charlize stayed single until<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Richard Rawlings</strong></a> asked <strong>Seth Rogan</strong> (Charlize's friend) her phone number, and tweeted saying, the fact that no one has stepped up to court,</p><p>''@CharlizeAfricais the craziest thing I've read today! I'm ready when you are Charlize, let's go for a ride! Hey @sethroganmind, setting a friend up?''</p><p>Theron, however, has not replied to Richard's tweet.</p><h2>Mother Of Two Children</h2><p>Even though the famous actress is still unmarried and does not share any child with her former partners, Charlize is a proud mother to two adopted children. In March 2012, Theron adopted <strong>Jackson Theron</strong>,<strong> </strong>and after three years, in July 2015, she adopted a daughter named <strong>August Theron</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently in April 2019, Charlize stated that her child Jackson is a transgender girl,&nbsp;</p><p>''They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find &nbsp;themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide.''&nbsp;</p><p>The star even revealed that she thought her child was a boy at first. She told,</p><p><i>''Yes, I thought she was a boy, too. Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: 'I am not a boy! So there you go! I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect, and I want to see thrive.''</i></p><p>The actress, moreover, is enjoying her motherhood, raising her two adorable kids.&nbsp;</p><h2>Health Issues</h2><p>Charlize suffered from Jaundice when she was a child. The disease even created her dental problems. In an interview, she revealed about her condition,&nbsp;</p><p>"I had no teeth until I was 11. I had these fangs because I had jaundice when I was a kid and I was put on so many antibiotics that my teeth rotted. They had to cut them out. So I never had baby teeth".&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the early 2000s, she felt down while filming a series of back handsprings for the movie, <i>Æon Flux </i>in Germany, Charlize.
