She went through the numbers of failed relationships. But she never let her expectations down and went on dating numbers of guys.&nbsp;</p><p>The star is currently dating famous American actor Brad Pitt. The pair was first spotted in late 2018.</p><p>As per reports, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pitt was watching If Beale Street Could Talk</a>, where Theron was invited as a special guest. Brad then joined Charlize in the bar, and both seemed very close as Pitt was holding her in his arms and winked at Theron. As a matter of fact, the two were introduced by a celebrity mutual friend, <strong>Sean Penn </strong>(Charlize's ex-fiance).</p><h2>Charlize Theron's Past Affair With Stephan Jenkins</h2><p>Multi-Award winning actress was previously in a romantic relationship with American singer <strong>Stephan Jenkins</strong>. The duo started dating in October 1998 after a few meetings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Stephan%20Jenkins-1573807327830.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the pair decided to break-up after dating for three years in October 2001. Both of them went separate ways with no explanation behind their split.&nbsp;</p><h2>Relationship With Stuart Townsend</h2><p>Almost after a year of her separation with Stephan, Charlize met <strong>Stuart Townsend</strong> on the set of Trapped in 2002. The lovebirds soon fell in love and started living together in Los Angeles and later moved to Ireland.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Stuart-1573807386859.jpg><p>The duo was going great until they began facing personal issues. After years of togetherness, the pair decided to end their eight years of relationship in January 2010.</p><h2>Unsuccessful Love life with Sean Penn</h2><p>The South African actress stayed single for more than three years after her split with Stuart. But in December 2013, she met actor <strong>Sean Penn </strong>during the shooting of the movie and eventually fell in love.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/15/Charlizwe%20Theron%20and%20Sean%20Penn-1573807456784.jpg><p>Theron and Penn also announced their engagement in December 2014, but after a year, they called off their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then Charlize stayed single until<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Richard Rawlings</strong></a> asked <strong>Seth Rogan</strong> (Charlize's friend) her phone number, and tweeted saying, the fact that no one has stepped up to court,</p><p>''@CharlizeAfricais the craziest thing I've read today! I'm ready when you are Charlize, let's go for a ride! Hey @sethroganmind, setting a friend up?''</p><p>Theron, however, has not replied to Richard's tweet.</p><h2>Mother Of Two Children</h2><p>Even though the famous actress is still unmarried and does not share any child with her former partners, Charlize is a proud mother to two adopted children. In March 2012, Theron adopted <strong>Jackson Theron</strong>,<strong> </strong>and after three years, in July 2015, she adopted a daughter named <strong>August Theron</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently in April 2019, Charlize stated that her child Jackson is a transgender girl,&nbsp;</p><p>''They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find &nbsp;themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide.''&nbsp;</p><p>The star even revealed that she thought her child was a boy at first. She told,</p><p><i>''Yes, I thought she was a boy, too. Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: 'I am not a boy! So there you go! I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect, and I want to see thrive.''</i></p><p>The actress, moreover, is enjoying her motherhood, raising her two adorable kids.&nbsp;</p><h2>Health Issues</h2><p>Charlize suffered from Jaundice when she was a child. The disease even created her dental problems. In an interview, she revealed about her condition,&nbsp;</p><p>"I had no teeth until I was 11. I had these fangs because I had jaundice when I was a kid and I was put on so many antibiotics that my teeth rotted. They had to cut them out.
