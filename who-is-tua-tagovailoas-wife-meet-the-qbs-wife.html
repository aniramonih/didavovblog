He is an American football quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.&nbsp;He was born on March 2, 1998, in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, United States. The NFL player is making waves in the sports industry, taking the league by storm.&nbsp;</p><p>Tua Tagovailoa has come a long way from being a kid who hugged football tightly in his sleep.&nbsp;He grew up with an empty pocket and a bag of dreams. But his intense passion for football and his discipline made him successful at a young age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-9_17_36_25.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When Did Tua Tagovailoa Start Playing Football?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tua Tagovailoa’s dance to success began when he attended the Saint Louis School in Honolulu, where he started playing street football. He would go back to his uncle after each game to give reports of how he performed. The NFL quarterback almost quit playing football when he lost his uncle. However, the famous athlete concluded that attaining success in the sport would be the best way to honor his uncle’s memory.&nbsp;</p><p>The NFL star attended the University of Alabama, where he played college football. His talent caused a stir in the team. He was a fresher when he won the Offensive MVP of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship. The star athlete was a force to reckon with in college, where he ultimately won the Maxwell and Walter Camp Awards in his sophomore year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-9_17_37_4.jpg><p>Tua Tagovailoa plays in the NFL as the Miami Dolphins QB. Tagovailoa is a left-handed NFL player who has set many records at a young age. The star player sustained a career-ending injury during the 2022 season but decided not to retire and returned to the NFL.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tua_Tagovailoas_Wife></span>Who Is Tua Tagovailoa’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tua Tagovailoa keeps a tightly closed lid on his marriage. In a world where celebrities and athletes build personal brands around their daily lifestyles on social media to increase their popularity, Tagovailoa relies solely on his strength and talent.&nbsp;</p><p>The NFL player is married to Annah Gore. However, his marriage is stringently kept private from the media. Gore is famously known as Tua Tagovailoa’s wife.</p><p>Annah Concetta Gore was born on June 11, 1999, in High Point, North Carolina, United States. She is an entrepreneur who works in the Corporate Sector in Virginia, United States.</p><p>Tua Tagovailoa’s wife attended a local school in her town, and like the NFL star, she also attended the University of Alabama. Annah Gore enjoys spending time with her loved ones. While wives of other sports athletes revel in social media attention, she loves her privacy. If her Instagram page is anything to go by, Gore is a private person who loves staying under the radar.&nbsp;</p><p>Tagovailoa and Gore reportedly met in high school. The pair got along pretty well and attended the University of Alabama together. The love between the couple bloomed over time, leading to the news of their nuptials.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Tua_Tagovailoa_and_Annah_Gore_Get_Married></span>When Did Tua Tagovailoa and Annah Gore Get Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The lovebirds exchanged their vows in a very intimate wedding on July 18, 2022, in Davie, Florida. The wedding had close friends and family of the couple in attendance. Tagovailoa and Gore preferred a secret marriage, but as a famous NFL quarterback, privacy is a luxury you can’t afford.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple planned to exchange their vows intimately. However, to their disdain, the news of their marriage was all over social media.&nbsp;Their marriage is shrouded in mystery, and the young couple wants to keep their life under the radar.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-1-1-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Do_Tua_Tagovailoa_and_His_Wife_Have></span>How Many Children Do Tua Tagovailoa and His Wife Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tua Tagovailoa and his wife have a son; they welcomed him during Thanksgiving 2022. But the details of his birth are still undisclosed to the public.</p><p>In an interview, the superstar opened up on how fatherhood has been a new experience for him. He <a href=#>said</a>: “It’s very unique how having a child impacts how you see things differently in life. It’s like nothing that I’ve ever experienced. There’s no playbook for this”.</p><p>Tagovailoa and Gore are committed to their family and keeping it away from the limelight. Another celebrity who keeps her marriage away from the spotlight is <a href=#>Lainey Wilson</a>. Very little is known about the man she said ‘I do’ to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqyllnq1rcaorZqhnKSutHnWop2eZZ2asrV506GcZqmSqHq4tcWeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html&text=Who%20Is%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%27s%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20the%20QB%27s%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%27s%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20the%20QB%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%27s%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20the%20QB%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%27s%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20the%20QB%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-tua-tagovailoas-wife-meet-the-qbs-wife.html&description=Who%20Is%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%27s%20Wife%3f%20Meet%20the%20QB%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./basketball-wives-la-bbw-brooke-bailey-pummels-fights-jackie-christie-tears-out-weave-1101.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Basketball Wives L.A.s Brooke Bailey Pummels Jackie Christie Tears Out Weave">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./thea-hail-wiki-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Thea Hail?
